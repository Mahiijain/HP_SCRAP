Bridgeport Bear\n; from\nPogo\n, Walt Kelly\nPleased to meet you.\nA list of all links for the current documentation is on the\nSite Map\npage. Documentation for older software versions can be found in the\ndocumentation archives\n.\nTable of Contents\nIntroduction\nThe Handbook\nBuilding and Installing NTP\nResolving Problems\nFurther Information\nIntroduction\nNote: The NTP Version 4 software contained in this distribution is available without charge under the conditions set forth in the\nCopyright Notice\n.\nIt is very important that readers understand that the NTP document collection began 25 years ago and remains today a work in progress. It has evolved as new features were invented and old features retired. It has been widely copied, cached and morphed to other formats, including man pages, with varying loss of fidelity. However, these HTML pages are the ONLY authoritative and definitive reference. Readers should always use the collection that comes with the distribution they use. A copy of the online collection is normally included in the most recent snapshot, but might not agree with an earlier snapshot or release version.\nThis distribution is an implementation of\nRFC-5905 “Network Time Protocol Version 4: Protocol and Algorithms Specification”\n.\nNTP is widely used to synchronize a computer to Internet time servers or other sources, such as a radio or satellite receiver or telephone modem service. It can also be used as a server for dependent clients. It provides accuracies typically less than a millisecond on LANs and up to a few milliseconds on WANs. Typical NTP configurations utilize multiple redundant servers and diverse network paths in order to achieve high accuracy and reliability.\nThis distribution includes a simulation framework in which substantially all the runtime NTP operations and most features can be tested and evaluated. This has been very useful in exploring in vitro response to unusual circumstances or over time periods impractical in vivo. Details are on the\nNetwork Time Protocol (NTP) Simulator\npage.\nThe Handbook\nA good deal of tutorial and directive information is available on the handbook pages. These should be read in conjunction with the command and option information available on the pages listed on the sitemap page.\nNTP Version 4 Release Notes\n: Lists recent changes and new features in the current distribution.\nAssociation Management\n: Describes how to configure servers and peers and manage the various options. Includes automatic server discovery schemes.\nAutomatic Server Discovery Schemes\n: Describes automatic server discovery using broadcast, multicast, manycast and server pool scheme.\nAccess Control Support\n: Describes the access control mechanisms that can be used to limit client access to various time and management functions.\nAuthentication Support\n: Describes the authentication mechanisms for symmetric-key and public-key cryptography.\nRate Management\n: Describes the principles of rate management to minimize network load and defend against DoS attacks.\nReference Clock Support\n: Describes the collection of radio clocks used to synchronize primary servers.\nHow NTP Works\n: Gives an overview of the NTP daemon architecture and how it works.\nBuilding and Installing NTP\nNTP supports Unix, VMS and Windows (2000 and later) systems. The\nBuilding and Installing the Distribution\npage details the procedures for building and installing on a typical system. This distribution includes drivers for many radio and satellite receivers and telephone modem services in the US, Canada and Europe. A list of supported drivers is on the\nReference Clock Drivers\npage. The default build includes the debugging options and all drivers that run on the target machine; however, options and drivers can be included or excluded using options on the\nConfiguration Options\npage.\nResolving Problems\nLike other things in modern Internet life, NTP problems can be devilishly intricate. This distribution includes a number of utilities designed to identify and repair problems using an integrated management protocol supported by the\nntpq\nutility program.\nThe\nNTP Debugging Techniques\nand\nHints and Kinks\npages contain useful information for identifying problems and devising solutions. Additional information on reference clock driver construction and debugging is in the\nDebugging Hints for Reference Clock Drivers\npage.\nUsers are invited to report bugs and offer suggestions via the\nNTP Bug Reporting Procedures\npage.\nFurther Information\nThe\nSite Map\npage contains a list of document collections arranged by topic. The Program Manual Pages collection may be the best place to start. The\nCommand Index\ncollection contains a list of all configuration file commands together with a short function description. A great wealth of additional information is available in the\nReference Library\n, including a book and numerous background papers and briefing presentations.\nBackground information on computer network time synchronization is on the\nExecutive Summary - Computer Network Time Synchronization\npage. Discussion on new features and interoperability with previous NTP versions is on the\nNTP Version 4 Release Notes\npage. Background information, bibliography and briefing slides suitable for presentations are on the\nNetwork Time Synchronization Research Project\npage.\n© 2025\nNetwork Time Foundation"

First, a machine can obtain the time from\n    a server that is a reliable time source. Second, a machine can itself act\n    as a time source for other computers in the network. The goal is\n    twofold—maintaining the absolute time and synchronizing the system\n    time of all machines within a network.\nMaintaining an exact system time is important in many situations. The\n  built-in hardware clock does often not meet the requirements of applications\n  such as databases or clusters. Manual correction of the system time would\n  lead to severe problems because, for example, a backward leap can cause\n  malfunction of critical applications. Within a network, it is usually\n  necessary to synchronize the system time of all machines, but manual time\n  adjustment is a bad approach. NTP provides a mechanism to solve these\n  problems. The NTP service continuously adjusts the system time with reliable\n  time servers in the network. It further enables the management of local\n  reference clocks, such as radio-controlled clocks.\nSince\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n15,\nchrony\nis the default implementation of NTP.\nchrony\nincludes two parts;\nchronyd\nis a daemon that can be started at\n  boot time and\nchronyc\nis a command line interface program to monitor the\n  performance of\nchronyd\n, and to change various operating parameters at\n  runtime.\nStarting with\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n15.2, the YaST module for NTP client\n  configuration configures the systemd-timer instead of the cron daemon\n  to execute\nchrony\n, when it is not configured to run as a daemon.\n38.1\nConfiguring an NTP client with YaST\n#\nThe NTP daemon (\nchronyd\n) coming with the\nchrony\npackage is preset to use the local computer hardware clock as a time\n   reference. The precision of the hardware clock heavily depends on its time\n   source. For example, an atomic clock or GPS receiver is a very precise time\n   source, while a common RTC chip is not a reliable time source. YaST\n   simplifies the configuration of an NTP client.\nIn the YaST NTP client configuration (\nNetwork\n   Services\n›\nNTP Configuration\n)\n   window, you can specify when to start the NTP daemon, the type of the\n   configuration source, and add custom time servers.\nFigure 38.1:\nNTP configuration window\n#\n38.1.1\nNTP daemon start\n#\nYou can choose from three options for when to start the NTP daemon:\nOnly manually\nSelect\nOnly Manually\n, if you want to manually start\n       the\nchrony\ndaemon.\nSynchronize without daemon\nSelect\nSynchronize without Daemon\nto set the system\n       time periodically without a permanently running\nchrony\n. You can set\n       the\nInterval of the Synchronization in Minutes\n.\nNow and on boot\nSelect\nNow and On Boot\nto start\nchronyd\nautomatically when the system is booted. This setting is recommended.\n38.1.2\nType of the configuration source\n#\nIn the\nConfiguration Source\ndrop-down box, select\n    either\nDynamic\nor\nStatic\n. Set\nStatic\nif your server uses only a fixed set of (public)\n    NTP servers, while\nDynamic\nis better if your internal\n    network offers NTP servers via DHCP.\n38.1.3\nConfigure time servers\n#\nTime servers for the client to query are listed in the lower part of the\nNTP Configuration\nwindow. Modify this list as needed\n    with\nAdd\n,\nEdit\n, and\nDelete\n.\nClick\nAdd\nto add a new time server:\nFigure 38.2:\nAdding a time server\n#\nIn the\nAddress\nfield, type the URL of the time server\n      or pool of time servers with which you want to synchronize the machine\n      time. After the URL is complete, click\nTest\nto verify\n      that it points to a valid time source.\nActivate\nQuick Initial Sync\nto speed up the time\n      synchronization by sending more requests at the\nchronyd\ndaemon start.\nActivate\nStart Offline\nto speed up the boot time on\n      systems that start the\nchronyd\ndaemon automatically and may not have an\n      Internet connection at boot time. This option is useful, for example, for\n      laptops with network connections managed by NetworkManager.\nConfirm with\nOK\n.\n38.2\nManually configuring NTP in the network\n#\nchrony\nreads its configuration from the\n/etc/chrony.conf\nfile. To keep the computer clock\n   synchronized, you need to tell\nchrony\nwhat time servers to use. You can\n   use specific server names or IP addresses, for example:\n0.suse.pool.ntp.org\n1.suse.pool.ntp.org\n2.suse.pool.ntp.org\n3.suse.pool.ntp.org\nYou can also specify a\npool\nname. Pool name resolves to\n   several IP addresses:\npool pool.ntp.org\nTip: Computers on the same network\nTo synchronize time on multiple computers on the same network, we do not\n    recommend to synchronize all of them with an external server. A good\n    practice is to make one computer the time server which is synchronized with\n    an external time server, and the other computers act as its clients. Add a\nlocal\ndirective to the server's\n/etc/chrony.conf\nto distinguish it from an\n    authoritative time server:\nlocal stratum 10\nTo start\nchrony\n, run:\nsystemctl start chronyd.service\nAfter initializing\nchronyd\n, it takes some time before the time is\n   stabilized and the drift file for correcting the local computer clock is\n   created. With the drift file, the systematic error of the hardware clock can\n   be computed when the computer is powered on. The correction is used\n   immediately, resulting in a higher stability of the system time.\nTo enable the service so that\nchrony\nstarts automatically at boot time,\n   run:\nsystemctl enable chronyd.service\nWarning: Conflicting\nyast-timesync.service\nservice\nIn addition to the\nchronyd.service\nservice,\nSLES\nincludes\nyast-timesync.service\n.\nyast-timesync.service\nis triggered by a timer\n    every 5 minutes and runs\nchronyd\nwith the\n-q\noption to\n    set the system time and exit. Because only one instance of\nchronyd\ncan be\n    running at any given time, do not enable or start both\nchronyd\n-related\n    services at the same time.\n38.3\nConfigure\nchronyd\nat runtime using\nchronyc\n#\nYou can use\nchronyc\nto change the behavior of\nchronyd\nat runtime. It\n   also generates status reports about the operation of\nchronyd\n.\nYou can run\nchronyc\neither in interactive or non-interactive mode. To\n   run\nchronyc\ninteractively, enter\nchronyc\non the command line. It\n   displays a prompt and waits for your command input. For example, to check\n   how many NTP sources are online or offline, run:\n#\nchronyc\nchronyc> activity\n200 OK\n4 sources online\n2 sources offline\n1 sources doing burst (return to online)\n1 sources doing burst (return to offline)\n0 sources with unknown address\nTo exit\nchronyc\n's prompt, enter\nquit\nor\nexit\n.\nIf you do not need to use the interactive prompt, enter the command\n   directly:\n#\nchronyc\nactivity\nNote: Temporary changes\nChanges made using\nchronyc\nare not permanent. They will be lost after the\n    next\nchronyd\nrestart. For permanent changes, modify\n/etc/chrony.conf\n.\nFor a complete list of\nchronyc\ncommands, see its manual page (\nman\n   1 chronyc\n).\n38.4\nDynamic time synchronization at runtime\n#\nAlthough\nchronyd\nstarts up normally on a system that boots without a network\n  connection, the tool cannot resolve the DNS names of the time servers\n  specified in the configuration file.\nchronyd\nkeeps trying to resolve the time server names specified by the\nserver\n,\npool\n, and\npeer\ndirectives in an increasing time interval until it succeeds.\nIf the time server will not be reachable when\nchronyd\nis started, you can\n   specify the\noffline\noption:\nserver\nserver_address\noffline\nchronyd\nwill then not try to poll the server until it is enabled using the\n   following command:\n#\nchronyc online\nserver_address\nWhen the\nauto_offline\noption is set,\nchronyd\nassumes that\n   the time server has gone offline when two requests have been sent to it\n   without receiving a response. This option avoids the need to run the\n   'offline' command from\nchronyc\nwhen disconnecting the network link.\n38.5\nSetting up a local reference clock\n#\nThe software package\nchrony\nrelies on other programs (such as\ngpsd\n) to access the timing data via the SHM or SOCK\n   driver. Use the\nrefclock\ndirective in\n/etc/chrony.conf\nto specify a hardware reference clock\n   to be used as a time source. It has two mandatory parameters: a driver name\n   and a driver-specific parameter. The two parameters are followed by zero or\n   more\nrefclock\noptions.\nchronyd\nincludes the following\n   drivers:\nPPS - driver for the kernel 'pulse per second' API. For example:\nrefclock PPS /dev/pps0 lock NMEA refid GPS\nSHM - NTP shared memory driver. For example:\nrefclock SHM 0 poll 3 refid GPS1\nrefclock SHM 1:perm=0644 refid GPS2\nSOCK - Unix domain socket driver. For example:\nrefclock SOCK /var/run/chrony.ttyS0.sock\nPHC - PTP hardware clock driver. For example:\nrefclock PHC /dev/ptp0 poll 0 dpoll -2 offset -37\nrefclock PHC /dev/ptp1:nocrossts poll 3 pps\nFor more information on individual drivers' options, see\nman 8\n   chrony.conf\n.\n38.6\nClock synchronization to an external time reference (ETR)\n#\nSupport for clock synchronization to an external time reference (ETR) is\n   available. The external time reference sends an oscillator signal and a\n   synchronization signal every 2**20 (2 to the power of 20) microseconds to\n   keep TOD clocks of all connected servers synchronized.\nFor availability two ETR units can be connected to a machine. If the clock\n   deviates for more than the sync-check tolerance all CPUs get a machine check\n   that indicates that the clock is not synchronized. If this happens, all DASD I/O\n   to XRC enabled devices is stopped until the clock is synchronized again.\nThe ETR support is activated via two\nsysfs\nattributes;\n   run the following commands as\nroot\n:\necho 1 > /sys/devices/system/etr/etr0/online\necho 1 > /sys/devices/system/etr/etr1/online\nOn this page\n38.1\nConfiguring an NTP client with YaST\n38.2\nManually configuring NTP in the network\n38.3\nConfigure\nchronyd\nat runtime using\nchronyc\n38.4\nDynamic time synchronization at runtime\n38.5\nSetting up a local reference clock\n38.6\nClock synchronization to an external time reference (ETR)\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

New\n    in\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n15 SP4\nis YaST support for\nsystemd\nsocket-based\n    services activation, which configures services to start on demand.\n38\nTime synchronization with NTP\nThe NTP (network time protocol) mechanism is a protocol for synchronizing\n    the system time over the network. First, a machine can obtain the time from\n    a server that is a reliable time source. Second, a machine can itself act\n    as a time source for other computers in the network. The goal is\n    twofold—maintaining the absolute time and synchronizing the system\n    time of all machines within a network.\n39\nThe domain name system\nDNS (domain name system) is needed to resolve the domain names and host\n    names into IP addresses. In this way, the IP address 192.168.2.100 is assigned to\n    the host name\njupiter\n, for example. Before setting up your\n    own name server, read the general information about DNS in\nSection 23.3, “Name resolution”\n. The following configuration\n    examples refer to BIND, the default DNS server.\n40\nDHCP\nThe purpose of the\nDynamic Host Configuration Protocol\n(DHCP) is to assign network settings centrally (from a server) rather than\n    configuring them locally on every workstation. A host configured to use\n    DHCP does not have control over its own static address. It is enabled to\n    configure itself completely and automatically according to directions from\n    the server. If you use the NetworkManager on the client side, you do not need to\n    configure the client. This is useful if you have changing environments and\n    only one interface active at a time. Never use NetworkManager on a machine that runs\n    a DHCP server.\n41\nSLP\nConfiguring a network client requires detailed knowledge about services\n    provided over the network (such as printing or LDAP, for example). To make\n    it easier to configure such services on a network client, the\n“\nservice location protocol\n”\n(SLP) was developed. SLP makes the\n    availability and configuration data of selected services known to all\n    clients in the local network. Applications that support SLP can use this\n    information to be configured automatically.\n42\nThe Apache HTTP server\nAccording to the surveys from\nhttp://www.netcraft.com/\nand\nhttps://w3techs.com/\n, the Apache HTTP Server\n    (Apache) is one of the world's most popular Web servers. Developed by the\n    Apache Software Foundation\n    (\nhttp://www.apache.org/\n), it is available for\n    most operating systems.\nSUSE® Linux Enterprise Server\nincludes Apache version 2.4. This\n    chapter describes how to install, configure, and operate Apache. It also\n    shows how to use additional modules, such as SSL, and how to troubleshoot\n    Apache.\n43\nSetting up an FTP server with YaST\nUsing the YaST\nFTP Server\nmodule, you can configure\n    your machine to function as an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) server.\n    Anonymous and/or authenticated users can connect to your machine and\n    download files using the FTP protocol. Depending on the configuration, they\n    can also upload files to the FTP server. YaST uses vsftpd (Very Secure\n    FTP Daemon).\n44\nSquid caching proxy server\nSquid is a widely-used caching proxy server for Linux and Unix platforms.\n    This means that it stores requested Internet objects, such as data on a Web\n    or FTP server, on a machine that is closer to the requesting workstation\n    than the server. It can be set up in multiple hierarchies to assure optimal\n    response times and low bandwidth usage, even in modes that are transparent\n    to end users.\n45\nWeb Based Enterprise Management using SFCB\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

Although GUIs offer many features, they are limited\n    when performing automated task execution. Shells complement\n    GUIs well, and this chapter gives an overview of some aspects of\n    shells, in this case the Bash shell.\n2\nsudo\nbasics\nRunning certain commands requires root privileges. However, for security\n  reasons and to avoid mistakes, it is not recommended to log in as\nroot\n. A safer approach is to log in as a regular user, and\n  then use\nsudo\nto run commands with elevated privileges.\n3\nUsing YaST\nYaST is a SUSE Linux Enterprise Server tool that provides a graphical interface for all essential installation and system configuration tasks. Whether you need to update packages, configure a printer, modify firewall settings, set up an FTP server, or partition a hard disk—you can do it using YaST. …\n4\nYaST in text mode\nThe ncurses-based pseudo-graphical YaST interface is designed primarily to help system administrators to manage systems without an X server. The interface offers several advantages compared to the conventional GUI. You can navigate the ncurses interface using the keyboard, and there are keyboard sho…\n5\nChanging language and country settings with YaST\nThis chapter explains how to configure language and country settings. You\n    can change the language globally for the whole system, individually for\n    certain users or desktops, or temporarily for single applications.\n    Additionally, you can configure secondary languages and adjust the date and\n    country settings.\n6\nManaging users with YaST\nDuring installation, you may have created a local user for your system.\n  With the YaST module\nUser and Group Management\nyou can\n  add users or edit existing ones. It also lets you configure your system\n  to authenticate users with a network server.\n7\nYaST online update\nSUSE offers a continuous stream of software security updates for your product. By default, the update applet is used to keep your system up to date. Refer to Section 8.5, “The GNOME package updater” for further information on the update applet. This chapter covers the alternative tool for updating s…\n8\nInstalling or removing software\nUse YaST's software management module to search for software components\n    you want to add or remove. YaST resolves all dependencies for you. To\n    install packages not shipped with the installation media, add\n    software repositories to your setup and let YaST manage them. Keep your\n    system up-to-date by managing software updates with the update applet.\n9\nManaging software with command line tools\nThis chapter describes Zypper and RPM, two command line tools for managing\n    software. For a definition of the terminology used in this context (for\n    example,\nrepository\n,\npatch\n, or\nupdate\n) refer to\nSection 8.1, “Definition of terms”\n.\n10\nSystem recovery and snapshot management with Snapper\nSnapper allows creating and managing file system snapshots.\n    File system snapshots allow keeping a copy of the state of a file system\n    at a certain point of time.\n    The standard setup of Snapper is designed to allow rolling back system\n    changes.\n    However, you can also use it to create on-disk backups of user data.\n    As the basis for this functionality, Snapper uses the Btrfs file system or\n    thinly-provisioned LVM volumes with an XFS or Ext4 file system.\n11\nLive kernel patching with KLP\nThis document describes the basic principles of the Kernel Live Patching (KLP)\n    technology, and provides usage guidelines for the SLE Live Patching\n    service.\n12\nUser space live patching\nThis chapter describes the basic principles and usage of user space\n        live patching.\n13\nTransactional updates\nTransactional updates are available in\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nas a technology\n    preview, for updating SLES when the root file system is read-only. \n    Transactional updates are atomic (all updates are applied only if all \n    updates succeed) and support rollbacks. It does not affect a running system \n    as no changes are activated until after the system is rebooted. As reboots\n    are disruptive, the admin must decide if a reboot is more expensive than\n    disturbing running services. If reboots are too expensive then do not use\n    transactional updates.\nTransactional updates are run daily by the\ntransactional-update\nscript. The script checks for\n    available updates. If there are any updates, it creates a new snapshot of\n    the root file system in the background, and then fetches updates from the\n    release channels. After the new snapshot is completely updated, it is\n    marked as active and will be the new default root file system after the next \n    reboot of the system. When\ntransactional-update\nis set to run\n    automatically (which is the default behavior) it also reboots the system.\n    Both the time that the update runs and the reboot maintenance window are \n    configurable.\nOnly packages that are part of the snapshot of the root file system can be\n    updated. If packages contain files that are not part of the snapshot, the\n    update could fail or break the system.\nRPMs that require a license to be accepted cannot be updated.\n14\nRemote graphical sessions with VNC\nVirtual Network Computing (VNC) enables you to access a remote computer\n    via a graphical desktop, and run remote graphical applications. VNC is \n    platform-independent and accesses the remote machine from any operating \n    system. This chapter describes how to connect to a VNC server with the \n    desktop clients vncviewer and Remmina, and how to operate a VNC server.\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nsupports two different kinds of VNC sessions: One-time\n    sessions that\n“\nlive\n”\nas long as the VNC connection from the\n    client is kept up, and persistent sessions that\n“\nlive\n”\nuntil\n    they are explicitly terminated.\nA VNC server can offer both kinds of sessions simultaneously on different\n   ports, but an open session cannot be converted from one type to the other.\n15\nFile copying with RSync\nToday, a typical user has several computers: home and workplace machines, a\n    laptop, a smartphone or a tablet. This makes the task of keeping files and\n    documents in synchronization across multiple devices all the more important.\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

Although GUIs offer many features, they are limited\n    when performing automated task execution. Shells complement\n    GUIs well, and this chapter gives an overview of some aspects of\n    shells, in this case the Bash shell.\n1.1\nWhat is\n“\nthe shell\n”\n?\n#\nTraditionally,\nthe\nLinux shell is Bash\n   (Bourne again Shell). When this chapter speaks about\n“\nthe shell\n”\nit means Bash. There are more shells available (ash, csh, ksh, zsh, …),\n   each employing different features and characteristics.\n1.1.1\nBash configuration files\n#\nA shell can be invoked as an:\nInteractive login shell.\nThis is used when logging in to a machine, invoking Bash with the\n--login\noption or when logging in to a remote machine\n       with SSH.\nInteractive non-login shell.\nThis is normally the case when starting xterm, konsole, gnome-terminal,\n       or similar command line interface (CLI) tools.\nNon-interactive non-login shell.\nThis is invoked when invoking a shell script at the command line.\nDepending on the type of shell you use, different configuration files will be\n    read. The following tables show the login and non-login shell\n    configuration files.\nTip\nBash looks for its configuration files in a specific order depending on\n     the type of shell where it is run. Find more details on the Bash man\n     page (\nman 1 bash\n). Search for the headline\nINVOCATION\n.\nTable 1.1:\nBash configuration files for login shells\n#\nFile\nDescription\n/etc/profile\nDo not modify this file, otherwise your modifications may be destroyed\n         during your next update!\n/etc/profile.local\nUse this file if you extend\n/etc/profile\n/etc/profile.d/\nContains system-wide configuration files for specific programs\n~/.profile\nInsert user specific configuration for login shells here\nNote that the login shell also sources the configuration files listed under\nTable 1.2, “Bash configuration files for non-login shells”\n.\nTable 1.2:\nBash configuration files for non-login shells\n#\n/etc/bash.bashrc\nDo not modify this file, otherwise your modifications may be destroyed\n         during your next update!\n/etc/bash.bashrc.local\nUse this file to insert your system-wide modifications for Bash only\n~/.bashrc\nInsert user specific configuration here\nAdditionally, Bash uses some more files:\nTable 1.3:\nSpecial files for Bash\n#\nFile\nDescription\n~/.bash_history\nContains a list of all commands you have typed\n~/.bash_logout\nExecuted when logging out\n~/.alias\nUser defined aliases of frequently used commands. See\nman 1 alias\nfor more details about defining\n         aliases.\nNo-Login Shells\n#\nThere are special shells that block users from logging into\n    the system:\n/bin/false\nand\n/sbin/nologin\n. Both fail silently\n    when the user attempts to log into the system. This was intended\n    as a security measure for system users, though modern\n    Linux operating systems have more effective tools for controlling system\n    access, such as PAM and AppArmor.\nThe default on\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nis to assign\n/bin/bash\nto human users, and\n/bin/false\nor\n/sbin/nologin\nto system users.\n    The\nnobody\nuser has\n/bin/bash\nfor historical reasons, as\n    it is a minimally-privileged user that used to be the default for system users.\n    However, whatever little bit of security gained by using\nnobody\nis lost when\n    multiple system users use it. It should be possible to change it to\n/sbin/nologin\n; the fastest way to test it is change\n    it and see if it breaks any services or applications.\nUse the following command to list which shells are assigned to all users,\n    system and human users, in\n/etc/passwd\n. The output\n    varies according to the services and users on your system:\n>\nsort -t: -k 7 /etc/passwd | awk -F: '{print $1\"\\t\" $7}' | column -t\ntux               /bin/bash\nnobody            /bin/bash\nroot              /bin/bash\navahi             /bin/false\nchrony            /bin/false\ndhcpd             /bin/false\ndnsmasq           /bin/false\nftpsecure         /bin/false\nlightdm           /bin/false\nmysql             /bin/false\npostfix           /bin/false\nrtkit             /bin/false\nsshd              /bin/false\ntftp              /bin/false\nunbound           /bin/false\nbin               /sbin/nologin\ndaemon            /sbin/nologin\nftp               /sbin/nologin\nlp                /sbin/nologin\nmail              /sbin/nologin\nman               /sbin/nologin\nnscd              /sbin/nologin\npolkitd           /sbin/nologin\npulse             /sbin/nologin\nqemu              /sbin/nologin\nradvd             /sbin/nologin\nrpc               /sbin/nologin\nstatd             /sbin/nologin\nsvn               /sbin/nologin\nsystemd-coredump  /sbin/nologin\nsystemd-network   /sbin/nologin\nsystemd-timesync  /sbin/nologin\nusbmux            /sbin/nologin\nvnc               /sbin/nologin\nwwwrun            /sbin/nologin\nmessagebus        /usr/bin/false\nscard             /usr/sbin/nologin\n1.1.2\nThe directory structure\n#\nThe following table provides a short overview of the most important\n  higher-level directories that you find on a Linux system. Find more detailed\n  information about the directories and important subdirectories in the\n  following list.\nTable 1.4:\nOverview of a standard directory tree\n#\nDirectory\nContents\n/\nRoot directory—the starting point of the directory tree.\n/bin\nEssential binary files, such as commands that are needed by both the\n       system administrator and normal users. Usually also contains the shells,\n       such as Bash.\n/boot\nStatic files of the boot loader.\n/dev\nFiles needed to access host-specific devices.\n/etc\nHost-specific system configuration files.\n/home\nHolds the home directories of all users who have accounts on the system.\n       However,\nroot\n's home directory is not located in\n/home\nbut in\n/root\n.\n/lib\nEssential shared libraries and kernel modules.\n/media\nMount points for removable media.\n/mnt\nMount point for temporarily mounting a file system.\n/opt\nAdd-on application software packages.\n/root\nHome directory for the superuser\nroot\n.\n/sbin\nEssential system binaries.\n/srv\nData for services provided by the system.\n/tmp\nTemporary files.\n/usr\nSecondary hierarchy with read-only data.\n/var\nVariable data such as log files.\n/windows\nOnly available if you have both Microsoft Windows* and Linux installed\n       on your system. Contains the Windows data.\nThe following list provides more detailed information and gives some examples\n  of which files and subdirectories can be found in the directories:\n/bin\nContains the basic shell commands that may be used both by\nroot\nand\n     by other users. These commands include\nls\n,\nmkdir\n,\ncp\n,\nmv\n,\nrm\nand\nrmdir\n.\n/bin\nalso contains Bash, the default shell in\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n.\n/boot\nContains data required for booting, such as the boot loader, the kernel,\n     and other data that is used before the kernel begins executing user-mode\n     programs.\n/dev\nHolds device files that represent hardware components.\n/etc\nContains local configuration files that control the operation of programs\n     like the X Window System. The\n/etc/init.d\nsubdirectory contains LSB init scripts that can be executed during the\n     boot process.\n/home/\nUSERNAME\nHolds the private data of every user who has an account on the system. The\n     files located here can only be modified by their owner or by the system\n     administrator. By default, your e-mail directory and personal desktop\n     configuration are located here in the form of hidden files and\n     directories, such as\n.gconf/\nand\n.config\n.\nNote: Home directory in a network environment\nIf you are working in a network environment, your home directory may be\n      mapped to a directory in the file system other than\n/home\n.\n/lib\nContains the essential shared libraries needed to boot the system and to\n     run the commands in the root file system. The Windows equivalent for\n     shared libraries are DLL files.\n/media\nContains mount points for removable media, such as CD-ROMs, flash disks,\n     and digital cameras (if they use USB).\n/media\ngenerally holds any type of drive except the hard disk of your system.\n     When your removable medium has been inserted or connected to the system\n     and has been mounted, you can access it from here.\n/mnt\nThis directory provides a mount point for a temporarily mounted file\n     system.\nroot\nmay mount file systems here.\n/opt\nReserved for the installation of third-party software. Optional software\n     and larger add-on program packages can be found here.\n/root\nHome directory for the\nroot\nuser. The personal data of\nroot\nis\n     located here.\n/run\nA tmpfs directory used by\nsystemd\nand various\n     components.\n/var/run\nis a symbolic link to\n/run\n.\n/sbin\nAs the\ns\nindicates, this directory holds utilities for\n     the superuser.\n/sbin\ncontains the binaries essential\n     for booting, restoring and recovering the system in addition to the\n     binaries in\n/bin\n.\n/srv\nHolds data for services provided by the system, such as FTP and HTTP.\n/tmp\nThis directory is used by programs that require temporary storage of\n     files.\nImportant: Cleaning up\n/tmp\nat boot time\nData stored in\n/tmp\nis not guaranteed to survive a\n      system reboot. It depends, for example, on settings made in\n/etc/tmpfiles.d/tmp.conf\n.\n/usr\n/usr\nhas nothing to do with users, but is the acronym\n     for Unix system resources. The data in\n/usr\nis\n     static, read-only data that can be shared among various hosts compliant\n     with the\nFilesystem Hierarchy Standard\n(FHS). This\n     directory contains all application programs including the graphical\n     desktops such as GNOME and establishes a secondary hierarchy in the file\n     system.\n/usr\nholds several subdirectories, such as\n/usr/bin\n,\n/usr/sbin\n,\n/usr/local\n, and\n/usr/share/doc\n.\n/usr/bin\nContains generally accessible programs.\n/usr/sbin\nContains programs reserved for the system administrator, such as repair\n     functions.\n/usr/local\nIn this directory the system administrator can install local,\n     distribution-independent extensions.\n/usr/share/doc\nHolds various documentation files and the release notes for your system.\n     In the\nmanual\nsubdirectory find an online version of\n     this manual. If more than one language is installed, this directory may\n     contain versions of the manuals for different languages.\nUnder\npackages\nfind the documentation included in the\n     software packages installed on your system. For every package, a\n     subdirectory\n/usr/share/doc/packages/\nPACKAGENAME\nis created that often holds README files for the package and sometimes\n     examples, configuration files or additional scripts.\nIf HOWTOs are installed on your system\n/usr/share/doc\nalso holds the\nhowto\nsubdirectory in which to find\n     additional documentation on many tasks related to the setup and operation\n     of Linux software.\n/var\nWhereas\n/usr\nholds static, read-only data,\n/var\nis for data which is written during system\n     operation and thus is variable data, such as log files or spooling data.\n     For an overview of the most important log files you can find under\n/var/log/\n, refer to\nTable 48.1, “Log files”\n.\n1.2\nWriting shell scripts\n#\nShell scripts provide a convenient way to perform a wide range of tasks: collecting\n   data, searching for a word or phrase in a text and other useful things.\n   The following example shows a small shell script that prints a text:\nExample 1.1:\nA shell script printing a text\n#\n#!/bin/sh\n1\n# Output the following line:\n2\necho \"Hello World\"\n3\n1\nThe first line begins with the\nShebang\ncharacters (\n#!\n) which indicate\n      that this file is a script. The interpreter, specified after the\nShebang\n, executes the script. In this case,\n      the specified interpreter is\n/bin/sh\n.\n2\nThe second line is a comment beginning with the hash sign. We recommend that you\n      comment difficult lines. With proper commenting, you can remember the purpose\n      and function of the line. Also, other readers will hopefully understand your\n      script. Commenting is considered good practice in the development community.\n3\nThe third line uses the built-in command\necho\nto print\n      the corresponding text.\nBefore you can run this script, there are a few prerequisites:\nEvery script should contain a Shebang line (as in the example above). If\n     the line is missing, you need to call the interpreter manually.\nYou can save the script wherever you want. However, it is a good idea to\n     save it in a directory where the shell can find it. The search path in a\n     shell is determined by the environment variable\nPATH\n.\n     Usually a normal user does not have write access to\n/usr/bin\n. Therefore it is recommended to save your\n     scripts in the users' directory\n~/bin/\n. The above\n     example gets the name\nhello.sh\n.\nThe script needs executable permissions. Set the permissions with the\n     following command:\n>\nchmod +x ~/bin/hello.sh\nIf you have fulfilled all of the above prerequisites, you can execute the\n   script in the following ways:\nAs absolute path.\nThe script can be executed with an absolute path. In our case, it is\n~/bin/hello.sh\n.\nEverywhere.\nIf the\nPATH\nenvironment variable contains the directory\n      where the script is located, you can execute the script with\nhello.sh\n.\n1.3\nRedirecting command events\n#\nEach command can use three channels, either for input or output:\nStandard output.\nThis is the default output channel. Whenever a command prints something,\n      it uses the standard output channel.\nStandard input.\nIf a command needs input from users or other commands, it uses this\n      channel.\nStandard error.\nCommands use this channel for error reporting.\nTo redirect these channels, there are the following possibilities:\nCommand > File\nSaves the output of the command into a file, an existing file will be\n      deleted. For example, the\nls\ncommand writes its output\n      into the file\nlisting.txt\n:\n>\nls > listing.txt\nCommand >> File\nAppends the output of the command to a file. For example, the\nls\ncommand appends its output to the file\nlisting.txt\n:\n>\nls >> listing.txt\nCommand < File\nReads the file as input for the given command. For example, the\nread\ncommand reads in the content of the file into the\n      variable:\n>\nread a < foo\nCommand1 | Command2\nRedirects the output of the left command as input for the right command.\n      For example, the\ncat\ncommand outputs the content of\n      the\n/proc/cpuinfo\nfile. This output is used by\ngrep\nto filter only those lines which contain\ncpu\n:\n>\ncat /proc/cpuinfo | grep cpu\nEvery channel has a\nfile descriptor\n: 0 (zero) for\n   standard input, 1 for standard output and 2 for standard error. It is\n   allowed to insert this file descriptor before a\n<\nor\n>\ncharacter. For example, the following line searches\n   for a file starting with\nfoo\n, but suppresses its errors\n   by redirecting it to\n/dev/null\n:\n>\nfind / -name \"foo*\" 2>/dev/null\n1.4\nUsing aliases\n#\nAn alias is a shortcut definition of one or more commands. The syntax for an\n   alias is:\nalias\nNAME\n=\nDEFINITION\nFor example, the following line defines an alias\nlt\nthat\n   outputs a long listing (option\n-l\n), sorts it by\n   modification time (\n-t\n), and prints it in reverse sorted order (\n-r\n):\n>\nalias lt='ls -ltr'\nTo view all alias definitions, use\nalias\n. Remove your\n   alias with\nunalias\nand the corresponding alias name.\n1.5\nUsing variables in Bash\n#\nA shell variable can be global or local. Global variables, or environment\n   variables, can be accessed in all shells. In contrast, local variables are\n   visible in the current shell only.\nTo view all environment variables, use the\nprintenv\ncommand. If you need to know the value of a variable, insert the name of\n   your variable as an argument:\n>\nprintenv PATH\nA variable, be it global or local, can also be viewed with\necho\n:\n>\necho $PATH\nTo set a local variable, use a variable name followed by the equal sign,\n   followed by the value:\n>\nPROJECT=\"SLED\"\nDo not insert spaces around the equal sign, otherwise you get an error. To\n   set an environment variable, use\nexport\n:\n>\nexport NAME=\"tux\"\nTo remove a variable, use\nunset\n:\n>\nunset NAME\nThe following table contains some common environment variables which can be\n   used in you shell scripts:\nTable 1.5:\nUseful environment variables\n#\nHOME\nthe home directory of the current user\nHOST\nthe current host name\nLANG\nwhen a tool is localized, it uses the language from this environment\n        variable. English can also be set to\nC\nPATH\nthe search path of the shell, a list of directories separated by colon\nPS1\nspecifies the normal prompt printed before each command\nPS2\nspecifies the secondary prompt printed when you execute a multi-line\n        command\nPWD\ncurrent working directory\nUSER\nthe current user\n1.5.1\nUsing argument variables\n#\nFor example, if you have the script\nfoo.sh\nyou can\n    execute it like this:\n>\nfoo.sh \"Tux Penguin\" 2000\nTo access all the arguments which are passed to your script, you need\n    positional parameters. These are\n$1\nfor the first argument,\n$2\nfor the second, and so on. You can have up to nine\n    parameters. To get the script name, use\n$0\n.\nThe following script\nfoo.sh\nprints all arguments from 1\n    to 4:\n#!/bin/sh\necho \\\"$1\\\" \\\"$2\\\" \\\"$3\\\" \\\"$4\\\"\nIf you execute this script with the above arguments, you get:\n\"Tux Penguin\" \"2000\" \"\" \"\"\n1.5.2\nUsing variable substitution\n#\nVariable substitutions apply a pattern to the content of a variable either\n    from the left or right side. The following list contains the possible\n    syntax forms:\n${VAR#pattern}\nremoves the shortest possible match from the left:\n>\nfile=/home/tux/book/book.tar.bz2\n>\necho ${file#*/}\nhome/tux/book/book.tar.bz2\n${VAR##pattern}\nremoves the longest possible match from the left:\n>\nfile=/home/tux/book/book.tar.bz2\n>\necho ${file##*/}\nbook.tar.bz2\n${VAR%pattern}\nremoves the shortest possible match from the right:\n>\nfile=/home/tux/book/book.tar.bz2\n>\necho ${file%.*}\n/home/tux/book/book.tar\n${VAR%%pattern}\nremoves the longest possible match from the right:\n>\nfile=/home/tux/book/book.tar.bz2\n>\necho ${file%%.*}\n/home/tux/book/book\n${VAR/pattern_1/pattern_2}\nsubstitutes the content of\nVAR\nfrom the\nPATTERN_1\nwith\nPATTERN_2\n:\n>\nfile=/home/tux/book/book.tar.bz2\n>\necho ${file/tux/wilber}\n/home/wilber/book/book.tar.bz2\n1.6\nGrouping and combining commands\n#\nShells allow you to concatenate and group commands for conditional\n   execution. Each command returns an exit code which determines the success or\n   failure of its operation. If it is 0 (zero) the command was successful,\n   everything else marks an error which is specific to the command.\nThe following list shows, how commands can be grouped:\nCommand1 ; Command2\nexecutes the commands in sequential order. The exit code is not checked.\n      The following line displays the content of the file with\ncat\nand then prints its file properties with\nls\nregardless of their exit codes:\n>\ncat filelist.txt ; ls -l filelist.txt\nCommand1 && Command2\nruns the right command, if the left command was successful (logical AND).\n      The following line displays the content of the file and prints its file\n      properties only, when the previous command was successful (compare it\n      with the previous entry in this list):\n>\ncat filelist.txt && ls -l filelist.txt\nCommand1 || Command2\nruns the right command, when the left command has failed (logical OR).\n      The following line creates only a directory in\n/home/wilber/bar\nwhen the creation of the directory\n      in\n/home/tux/foo\nhas failed:\n>\nmkdir /home/tux/foo || mkdir /home/wilber/bar\nfuncname(){ ... }\ncreates a shell function. You can use the positional parameters to access\n      its arguments. The following line defines the function\nhello\nto print a short message:\n>\nhello() { echo \"Hello $1\"; }\nYou can call this function like this:\n>\nhello Tux\nwhich prints:\nHello Tux\n1.7\nWorking with common flow constructs\n#\nTo control the flow of your script, a shell has\nwhile\n,\nif\n,\nfor\nand\ncase\nconstructs.\n1.7.1\nThe if control command\n#\nThe\nif\ncommand is used to check expressions. For\n    example, the following code tests whether the current user is Tux:\nif test $USER = \"tux\"; then\n  echo \"Hello Tux.\"\nelse\n  echo \"You are not Tux.\"\nfi\nThe test expression can be as complex or simple as possible. The following\n    expression checks if the file\nfoo.txt\nexists:\nif test -e /tmp/foo.txt ; then\n  echo \"Found foo.txt\"\nfi\nThe test expression can also be abbreviated in square brackets:\nif [ -e /tmp/foo.txt ] ; then\n  echo \"Found foo.txt\"\nfi\nFind more useful expressions at\nhttps://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/If..else..fi\n.\n1.7.2\nCreating loops with the\nfor\ncommand\n#\nThe\nfor\nloop allows you to execute commands to a list of\n    entries. For example, the following code prints some information about PNG\n    files in the current directory:\nfor i in *.png; do\n ls -l $i\ndone\n1.8\nMore information\n#\nImportant information about Bash is provided in the man pages\nman\n   bash\n.

However, for security\n  reasons and to avoid mistakes, it is not recommended to log in as\nroot\n. A safer approach is to log in as a regular user, and\n  then use\nsudo\nto run commands with elevated privileges.\nOn\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n,\nsudo\nis configured to work similarly to\nsu\n. However,\nsudo\nprovides a flexible mechanism that allows users to run commands with\n  privileges of any other user. This can be used to assign roles with specific\n  privileges to certain users and groups. For example, it is possible to allow\n  members of the group\nusers\nto run a command with the privileges of\n  user\nwilber\n. Access to the command can be further restricted by\n  disallowing any command options. While su always requires the\nroot\npassword for authentication with PAM,\nsudo\ncan be configured to\n  authenticate with your own credentials. This means that the users do not need\n  to share the\nroot\npassword, which improves security.\n2.1\nBasic\nsudo\nusage\n#\nThe following chapter provides an introduction to basic usage of\nsudo\n.\n2.1.1\nRunning a single command\n#\nAs a regular user, you can run any command as\nroot\nby\n    adding\nsudo\nbefore it. This prompts you to provide the root password. If\n    authenticated successfully, this runs the command as\nroot\n:\n>\nid -un\n1\ntux\n>\nsudo\nid -un\nroot's password:\n2\nroot\n>\nid -un\ntux\n3\n>\nsudo\nid -un\n4\nroot\n1\nThe\nid -un\ncommand prints the login name of the\n      current user.\n2\nThe password is not shown during input, neither as clear text nor as\n      masking characters.\n3\nOnly commands that start with\nsudo\nrun with elevated privileges.\n4\nThe elevated privileges persist for a certain period of time, so you\n      do not need to provide the\nroot\npassword again.\nTip: I/O redirection\nWhen using\nsudo\n, I/O redirection does not work:\n>\nsudo\necho s > /proc/sysrq-trigger\nbash: /proc/sysrq-trigger: Permission denied\n>\nsudo\ncat < /proc/1/maps\nbash: /proc/1/maps: Permission denied\nIn the example above, only the\necho\nand\ncat\ncommands run with elevated privileges. The\n     redirection is done by the user's shell with user privileges. To perform\n     redirection with elevated privileges, either start a shell as in\nSection 2.1.2, “Starting a shell”\nor use the\ndd\nutility:\necho s | sudo dd of=/proc/sysrq-trigger\nsudo dd if=/proc/1/maps | cat\n2.1.2\nStarting a shell\n#\nUsing\nsudo\nevery time to run a command with elevated privileges is not\n    always practical.  While you can use the\nsudo bash\ncommand, it is recommended to use one of the built-in mechanisms to start a\n    shell:\nsudo -s (<command>)\nStarts a shell specified by the\nSHELL\nenvironment\n       variable or the target user's default shell. If a command is specified, it\n       is passed to the shell (with the\n-c\noption). Otherwise the\n       shell runs in interactive mode.\ntux:~ >\nsudo -s\nroot's password:\nroot:/home/tux #\nexit\ntux:~ >\nsudo -i (<command>)\nSimilar to\n-s\n, but starts the shell as a login shell. This\n       means that the shell's start-up files (\n.profile\netc.) are processed, and the current working directory is set to the\n       target user's home directory.\ntux:~ >\nsudo -i\nroot's password:\nroot:~ #\nexit\ntux:~ >\nTip: Environment variables\nBy default,\nsudo\ndoes not propagate environment variables. This behavior\n    can be changed using the\nenv_reset\noption (see\nUseful flags and options\n).\n2.2\nConfiguring\nsudo\n#\nsudo\nprovides a wide range on configurable options.\nNote: Locked yourself out of sudo\nIf you accidentally locked yourself out of\nsudo\n, use\nsu\n    -\nand the\nroot\npassword to start a root shell.\n    To fix the error, run\nvisudo\n.\n2.2.1\nEditing the configuration files\n#\nThe main policy configuration file for\nsudo\nis\n/etc/sudoers\n. As it is possible to lock yourself out\n    of the system if the file is malformed, it is strongly recommended to use\nvisudo\nfor editing. It prevents editing conflicts and\n    checks for syntax errors before saving the modifications.\nYou can use another editor instead of vi by setting the\nEDITOR\nenvironment variable, for example:\nsudo EDITOR=\n/usr/bin/nano\nvisudo\nKeep in mind that the\n/etc/sudoers\nfile is supplied by\n    the system packages, and modifications done directly in the file may break\n    updates. Therefore, it is recommended to put custom configuration into\n    files in the\n/etc/sudoers.d/\ndirectory. Use the\n    following command to create or edit a file:\nsudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/\nNAME\nThe command bellow opens the file using a different editor (in this case,\nnano\n):\nsudo EDITOR=\n/usr/bin/nano\nvisudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/\nNAME\nNote: Ignored files in\n/etc/sudoers.d\nThe\n#includedir\ndirective in\n/etc/sudoers\nignores files that end with the\n~\n(tilde) character or contain the\n.\n(dot) character.\nFor more information on the\nvisudo\ncommand, run\nman 8 visudo\n.\n2.2.2\nBasic sudoers configuration syntax\n#\nThe sudoers configuration files contain two types of options: strings\n    and flags. While strings can contain any value, flags can be turned either\n    ON or OFF. The most important syntax constructs for sudoers configuration\n    files are as follows:\n# Everything on a line after # is ignored\n1\nDefaults !insults # Disable the insults flag\n2\nDefaults env_keep += \"DISPLAY HOME\" # Add DISPLAY and HOME to env_keep\ntux ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/frobnicate, PASSWD: /usr/bin/journalctl\n3\n1\nThere are two exceptions:\n#include\nand\n#includedir\nare regular commands.\n2\nRemove the\n!\ncharacter to set the desired flag to ON.\n3\nSee\nSection 2.2.3, “Basic sudoers rules”\n.\nUseful flags and options\n#\ntargetpw\nThis flag controls whether the invoking user is required to enter the\n      password of the target user (ON) (for example\nroot\n) or the invoking\n      user (OFF).\nDefaults targetpw # Turn targetpw flag ON\nrootpw\nIf set,\nsudo\nprompts for the\nroot\npassword. The default is OFF.\nDefaults !rootpw # Turn rootpw flag OFF\nenv_reset\nIf set,\nsudo\nconstructs a minimal environment with\nTERM\n,\nPATH\n,\nHOME\n,\nMAIL\n,\nSHELL\n,\nLOGNAME\n,\nUSER\n,\nUSERNAME\n, and\nSUDO_*\n. Additionally, variables listed in\nenv_keep\nare imported from the calling\n       environment. The default is ON.\nDefaults env_reset # Turn env_reset flag ON\nenv_keep\nList of environment variables to keep when the\nenv_reset\nflag is ON.\n# Set env_keep to contain EDITOR and PROMPT\nDefaults env_keep = \"EDITOR PROMPT\"\nDefaults env_keep += \"JRE_HOME\" # Add JRE_HOME\nDefaults env_keep -= \"JRE_HOME\" # Remove JRE_HOME\nenv_delete\nList of environment variables to remove when the\nenv_reset\nflag is OFF.\n# Set env_delete to contain EDITOR and PROMPT\nDefaults env_delete = \"EDITOR PROMPT\"\nDefaults env_delete += \"JRE_HOME\" # Add JRE_HOME\nDefaults env_delete -= \"JRE_HOME\" # Remove JRE_HOME\nThe\nDefaults\ntoken can also be used to create aliases\n    for a collection of users, hosts, and commands. Furthermore, it is possible\n    to apply an option only to a specific set of users.\nFor detailed information about the\n/etc/sudoers\nconfiguration file, consult\nman 5 sudoers\n.\n2.2.3\nBasic sudoers rules\n#\nEach rule follows the following scheme\n    (\n[]\nmarks optional parts):\n#Who      Where         As whom      Tag                What\nUser_List Host_List = [(User_List)] [NOPASSWD:|PASSWD:] Cmnd_List\nsudoers rule syntax\n#\nUser_List\nOne or several (separated by comma) identifiers: either a\n       user name, a group in the format\n%GROUPNAME\n, or a user\n       ID in the format\n#UID\n. Negation can be specified with\n       the\n!\nprefix.\nHost_List\nOne or several (separated by comma) identifiers: either a\n       (fully qualified) host name or an IP address. Negation can be specified\n       with the\n!\nprefix.\nALL\nis a common\n       choice for\nHost_List\n.\nNOPASSWD:|PASSWD:\nThe user is not prompted for a password when running commands\n       matching\nCmd_List\nafter\nNOPASSWD:\n.\nPASSWD\nis the default. It only needs to be specified\n       when both\nPASSWD\nand\nNOPASSWD\nare\n       on the same line:\ntux ALL = PASSWD: /usr/bin/foo, NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/bar\nCmnd_List\nOne or several (separated by comma) specifiers: A path to an\n       executable, followed by an optional allowed argument.\n/usr/bin/foo     # Anything allowed\n/usr/bin/foo bar # Only \"/usr/bin/foo bar\" allowed\n/usr/bin/foo \"\"  # No arguments allowed\nALL\ncan be used as\nUser_List\n,\nHost_List\n, and\nCmnd_List\n.\nA rule that allows\ntux\nto run all commands as root without\n    entering a password:\ntux ALL = NOPASSWD: ALL\nA rule that allows\ntux\nto run\nsystemctl restart\n    apache2\n:\ntux ALL = /usr/bin/systemctl restart apache2\nA rule that allows\ntux\nto run\nwall\nas\nadmin\nwith no arguments:\ntux ALL = (admin) /usr/bin/wall \"\"\nWarning: Unsafe rules\nDo not\nuse rules like\nALL ALL =\n     ALL\nwithout\nDefaults targetpw\n. Otherwise\n     anyone can run commands as\nroot\n.\nImportant: Winbind and sudo\nWhen specifying the group name in the\nsudoers\nfile, make sure that you use the NetBIOS domain name instead of the realm, for example:\n%DOMAIN\n\\\\\nGROUP_NAME\nALL = (ALL) ALL\nKeep in mind that when using winbindd, the format also depends on the\nwinbind separator\noption in the\nsmb.conf\nfile. By default, it is\n\\\n. If it is changed, for example, to\n+\n, then the account format in the\nsudoers\nfile must be\nDOMAIN+GROUP_NAME\n.\n2.3\nsudo\nuse cases\n#\nWhile the default configuration works for standard usage scenarios, you can\n   customize the default configuration to meet your specific needs.\n2.3.1\nUsing\nsudo\nwithout\nroot\npassword\n#\nBy design, members of the group\nwheel\ncan run all commands\n        with\nsudo\nas root. The following procedure explains how to add a user\n        account to the\nwheel\ngroup.\nVerify that the\nwheel\ngroup exists:\n>\ngetent group wheel\nIf the previous command returned no result, install the\nsystem-group-wheel\npackage that creates the\nwheel\ngroup:\n>\nsudo\nzypper install system-group-wheel\nAdd your user account to the group\nwheel\n.\nIf your user account is not already a member of the\nwheel\ngroup, add it\n            using the\nsudo usermod -a -G wheel\nUSERNAME\ncommand. Log out and\n            log in again to enable the change. Verify that the change was\n            successful by running the\ngroups\nUSERNAME\ncommand.\nAuthenticate with the user account's normal password.\nCreate the file\n/etc/sudoers.d/userpw\nusing\n            the\nvisudo\ncommand (see\nSection 2.2.1, “Editing the configuration files”\n) and add the following:\nDefaults !targetpw\nSelect a new default rule.\nDepending on whether you want users to re-enter their passwords,\n      uncomment the appropriate line in\n/etc/sudoers\nand\n      comment out the default rule.\n## Uncomment to allow members of group wheel to execute any command\n# %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\n## Same thing without a password\n# %wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\nMake the default rule more restrictive.\nComment out or remove the allow-everything rule in\n/etc/sudoers\n:\nALL     ALL=(ALL) ALL   # WARNING! Only use this together with 'Defaults targetpw'!\nWarning: Dangerous rule in sudoers\nDo not skip this step. Otherwise\nany\nuser can\n       execute\nany\ncommand as\nroot\n!\nTest the configuration.\nRun\nsudo\nas member and non-member of\nwheel\n.\ntux:~ >\ngroups\nusers wheel\ntux:~ >\nsudo id -un\ntux's password:\nroot\nwilber:~ >\ngroups\nusers\nwilber:~ >\nsudo id -un\nwilber is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.\n2.3.2\nUsing\nsudo\nwith X.Org applications\n#\nStarting graphical applications with\nsudo\nusually results in the following\n    error:\n>\nsudo\nxterm\nxterm: Xt error: Can't open display: %s\nxterm: DISPLAY is not set\nA simple workaround is to use xhost to temporarily allow the root user\n    to access the local user's X session. This is done using the following command:\nxhost si:localuser:root\nThe command below removes the granted access:\nxhost -si:localuser:root\nWarning: Potential security issue\nRunning graphical applications with root privileges has security\n     implications. It is recommended to enable root access for a graphical\n     application only as an exception. It is also recommended to revoke\n     the granted root access as soon as the graphical application is closed.\n2.4\nMore information\n#\nThe\nsudo --help\ncommand offers a brief overview of the\n   available command line options, while the\nman sudoers\ncommand provides detailed information about\nsudoers\nand its configuration.\nOn this page\n2.1\nBasic\nsudo\nusage\n2.2\nConfiguring\nsudo\n2.3\nsudo\nuse cases\n2.4\nMore information\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

Whether you need\n  to update packages, configure a printer, modify firewall settings, set up an\n  FTP server, or partition a hard disk—you can do it using\n  YaST. Written in Ruby, YaST features an extensible architecture that\n  makes it possible to add new functionality via modules.\nAdditional information about YaST is available on the project's official\n  Web site at\nhttps://yast.opensuse.org/\n.\n3.1\nYaST interface overview\n#\nYaST has two graphical interfaces: one for use with graphical desktop\n   environments like KDE and GNOME, and an ncurses-based pseudo-graphical\n   interface for use on systems without an X server (see\nChapter 4,\nYaST in text mode\n).\nIn the graphical version of YaST, all modules in YaST are grouped by\n   category, and the navigation sidebar allows you to quickly access modules in\n   the desired category. The search field at the top makes it possible to find\n   modules by their names. To find a specific module, enter its name into the\n   search field, and you should see the modules that match the entered string\n   as you type.\nImportant: List of installed YaST modules\nThe list of installed modules for the ncurses-based and GUI version of YaST\n      may differ. Before starting any YaST module, verify that it is installed\n      for the version of YaST that you are using.\n3.2\nUseful key combinations\n#\nThe graphical version of YaST supports keyboard\n  shortcuts\nPrint Screen\nTake and save a screenshot. It may not work on certain desktop environments.\nShift\n–\nF4\nEnable and disable the color palette optimized for visually-impaired users.\nShift\n–\nF7\nEnable/disable logging of debug messages.\nShift\n–\nF8\nOpen a file dialog to save log files to a user-defined location.\nCtrl\n–\nShift\n–\nAlt\n–\nD\nSend a DebugEvent.

The interface offers several advantages compared to the\n  conventional GUI. You can navigate the ncurses interface using the keyboard,\n  and there are keyboard shortcuts for practically all interface elements. The\n  ncurses interface is light on resources, and runs fast even on modest\n  hardware. You can run the ncurses-based version of YaST via an SSH\n  connection, so you can administer remote systems. Keep in mind that\n  the minimum supported size of the terminal emulator in which to run YaST is\n  80x25 characters.\nFigure 4.1:\nMain window of YaST in text mode\n#\nTo launch the ncurses-based version of YaST, open the terminal and run the\nsudo yast2\ncommand. Use the\n→|\nor\n  arrow keys to navigate between interface elements like menu\n  items, fields, and buttons. All menu items and buttons in YaST can be\n  accessed using the appropriate function keys or keyboard shortcuts. For\n  example, you can cancel the current operation by pressing\nF9\n, while the\nF10\nkey can be used to accept\n  the changes. Each menu item and button in YaST's ncurses-based interface\n  has a highlighted letter in its label. This letter is part of the keyboard\n  shortcut assigned to the interface element. For example, the letter\nQ\nis highlighted in the\nQuit\nbutton. This means that you can activate the button by pressing\nAlt\n–\nAlt+Q\n.\nTip: Refreshing YaST dialogs\nIf a YaST dialog gets corrupted or distorted (for example, while resizing\n   the window), press\nCtrl\n–\nL\nto refresh and restore its contents.\n4.1\nNavigation in modules\n#\nThe following description of the control elements in the YaST modules\n   assumes that all function keys and\nAlt\nkey combinations\n   work and are not assigned to different global functions. Read\nSection 4.3, “Restriction of key combinations”\nfor information about\n   possible exceptions.\nMoving between buttons and selection lists\nUse\n→|\nto move between the buttons and frames\n      containing selection lists. To navigate in the opposite direction, use\nAlt\n–\n→|\nor\nShift\n–\n→|\ncombinations.\nNavigating in selection lists\nUse the arrow keys (\n↑\nand\n↓\n) to move through the individual elements in an active\n      frame containing a selection list. If individual entries are longer than\n      the frame's width, use\nShift\n–\n→\nor\nShift\n–\n←\nto scroll\n      horizontally. If the arrow key causes the selection to move to another frame, use\nCtrl\n–\nE\nor\nCtrl\n–\nA\ninstead.\nWorking with buttons, radio buttons, and check boxes\nTo select items with empty square brackets (check boxes) or empty\n      parentheses (radio buttons), press\nSpace\nor\nEnter\n. Alternatively, radio buttons and check boxes\n      can be selected directly with\nAlt\n–\nhighlighted_letter\n.\n      In this case, you do not need to confirm with\nEnter\n.\n      If you navigate to an item with\n→|\n, press\nEnter\nto execute the selected action or activate the\n      respective menu item.\nFunction keys\nThe function keys (from\nF1\nto\nF12\n) enable\n      quick access to the various buttons. Available function key combinations\n      (\nF\nX\n) are shown in the\n      bottom line of the YaST screen. Which function keys are actually mapped\n      to which buttons depend on the active YaST module, because the\n      different modules offer different buttons (\nDetails\n,\nInfo\n,\nAdd\n,\nDelete\n, etc.). Use\nF10\nfor\nAccept\n,\nOK\n,\nNext\n, and\nFinish\n. Press\nF1\nto access the YaST help.\nUsing the navigation tree\nSome YaST modules use a navigation tree in the left part of the window\n      to select configuration dialogs. Use the arrow keys\n      (\n↑\nand\n↓\n) to navigate in\n      the tree. Use\nSpace\nto open or close tree items. In\n      the ncurses mode,\nEnter\nmust be pressed after a\n      selection in the navigation tree to show the selected dialog. This is an\n      intentional behavior to save time-consuming redraws when browsing through\n      the navigation tree.\nSelecting software in the software installation module\nUse the filters on the left side to list packages matching the specified\n      string. Installed packages are marked with the letter\ni\n. To change the status of a package, press\nSpace\nor\nEnter\n. Alternatively, use the\nActions\nmenu to select the needed status change\n      (install, delete, update, taboo, or lock).\nFigure 4.2:\nThe software installation module\n#\n4.2\nAdvanced key combinations\n#\nThe ncurses-based version of YaST offers several advanced key combinations.\nShift\n–\nF1\nList advanced hotkeys.\nShift\n–\nF4\nChange color schema.\nCtrl\n–\nQ\nQuit the application.\nCtrl\n–\nL\nRefresh screen.\nCtrl\n–\nD\nF1\nList advanced hotkeys.\nCtrl\n–\nD\nShift\n–\nD\nDump dialog to the log file as a screenshot.\nCtrl\n–\nD\nShift\n–\nY\nOpen YDialogSpy to see the widget hierarchy.\n4.3\nRestriction of key combinations\n#\nIf your window manager uses global\nAlt\ncombinations,\n   the\nAlt\ncombinations in YaST might not work. Keys\n   like\nAlt\nor\nShift\ncan also be\n   occupied by the settings of the terminal.\nUsing\nAlt\ninstead of\nEsc\nAlt\nshortcuts can be executed with\nEsc\ninstead of\nAlt\n. For\n      example,\nEsc\n–\nH\nreplaces\nAlt\n–\nH\n. (Press\nEsc\n,\nthen\npress\nH\n.)\nBackward and forward navigation with\nCtrl\n–\nF\nand\nCtrl\n–\nB\nIf the\nAlt\nand\nShift\ncombinations are taken over by the window manager or the terminal, use the\n      combinations\nCtrl\n–\nF\n(forward) and\nCtrl\n–\nB\n(backward)\n      instead.\nRestriction of function keys\nThe function keys (\nF1\n...\nF12\n) are also\n      used for functions. Certain function keys might be taken over by the\n      terminal and may not be available for YaST. However, the\nAlt\nkey combinations and function keys should always\n      be fully available on a text-only console.\n4.4\nYaST command line options\n#\nBesides the text mode interface, YaST provides a command line\n   interface. To get a list of YaST command line options, use the following\n   command:\n>\nsudo\nyast -h\n4.4.1\nInstalling packages from the command line\n#\nIf you know the package name, and the package is provided by an active\n    installation repository, you can use the command line option\n-i\nto install the package:\n>\nsudo\nyast\n-i package_name\nor\n>\nsudo\nyast --install\n-i package_name\npackage_name\ncan be a single short package name\n    (for example\ngvim\n) installed with dependency checking,\n    or the full path to an RPM package, which is installed without dependency\n    checking.\nWhile YaST offers basic functionality for managing software from the\n    command line, consider using Zypper for more advanced package management\n    tasks. Find more information on using Zypper in\nSection 9.1, “Using Zypper”\n.\n4.4.2\nWorking with individual modules\n#\nTo save time, you can start individual YaST modules using the following\n    command:\n>\nsudo\nyast\nmodule_name\nView a list of all modules available on your system with\nyast\n    -l\nor\nyast --list\n.\n4.4.3\nCommand line parameters of YaST modules\n#\nTo use YaST functionality in scripts, YaST provides command line\n    support for individual modules. However, not all modules have command line\n    support.  To display the available options of a module, use the following\n    command:\n>\nsudo\nyast\nmodule_name\nhelp\nIf a module does not provide command line support, it is started in a text\n    mode with the following message:\nThis YaST module does not support the command line interface.\nThe following sections describe all YaST modules with command line\n    support, along with a brief explanation of all their commands and\n    available options.\n4.4.3.1\nCommon YaST module commands\n#\nAll YaST modules support the following commands:\nhelp\nLists all the module's supported commands with their\n        description:\n>\nsudo\nyast lan help\nlonghelp\nSame as\nhelp\n, but adds a detailed list of all\n        command's options and their descriptions:\n>\nsudo\nyast lan longhelp\nxmlhelp\nSame as\nlonghelp\n, but the output is structured as\n        an XML document and redirected to a file:\n>\nsudo\nyast lan xmlhelp xmlfile=/tmp/yast_lan.xml\ninteractive\nEnters the\ninteractive\nmode.

You\n    can change the language globally for the whole system, individually for\n    certain users or desktops, or temporarily for single applications.\n    Additionally, you can configure secondary languages and adjust the date and\n    country settings.\nWorking in different countries or having to work in a multilingual\n  environment requires your computer to be set up to support this.\nSUSE® Linux Enterprise Server\ncan handle different\nlocales\nin parallel.\n  A locale is a set of parameters that defines the language and country\n  settings reflected in the user interface.\nThe main system language was selected during installation and keyboard and\n  time zone settings were adjusted. However, you can install additional\n  languages on your system and determine which of the installed languages\n  should be the default.\nFor those tasks, use the YaST language module as described in\nSection 5.1, “Changing the system language”\n. Install secondary languages to get optional\n  localization if you need to start applications or desktops in languages other\n  than the primary one.\nIn addition, the YaST timezone module allows you to adjust your country\n  and timezone settings accordingly. It also lets you synchronize your system\n  clock against a time server. For details, refer to\nSection 5.2, “Changing the country and time settings”\n.\n5.1\nChanging the system language\n#\nDepending on how you use your desktop and whether you want to switch the\n   entire system to another language or only the desktop environment itself,\n   there are several ways to do this:\nChanging the system language globally\nProceed as described in\nSection 5.1.1, “Modifying system languages with YaST”\nand\nSection 5.1.2, “Switching the default system language”\nto install additional localized\n      packages with YaST and to set the default language. Changes are\n      effective after the next login. To ensure that the entire system reflects\n      the change, reboot the system or close and restart all running services,\n      applications, and programs.\nChanging the language for the desktop only\nProvided you have previously installed the desired language packages for\n      your desktop environment with YaST as described below, you can switch\n      the language of your desktop using the desktop's control center.\n       After the\n      X server has been restarted, your entire desktop reflects your new choice\n      of language. Applications not belonging to your desktop framework are not\n      affected by this change and may still appear in the language that was set\n      in YaST.\nTemporarily switching languages for one application only\nYou can also run a single application in another language (that has\n      already been installed with YaST). To do so, start it from the command\n      line by specifying the language code as described in\nSection 5.1.3, “Switching languages for standard X and GNOME applications”\n.\n5.1.1\nModifying system languages with YaST\n#\nYaST has two different language categories:\nPrimary Language\nThe primary language set in YaST applies to the entire system,\n       including YaST and the desktop environment. This language is used\n       whenever available unless you manually specify another language.\nSecondary Languages\nInstall secondary languages to make your system multilingual. Languages\n       installed as secondary languages can be selected manually for a specific\n       situation. For example, use a secondary language to start an application\n       in a certain language to do word processing in this language.\nBefore installing additional languages, determine which of them should be\n    the default system language (primary language).\nTo access the YaST language module, start YaST and click\nSystem\n›\nLanguage\n.\n    Alternatively, start the\nLanguages\ndialog directly by\n    running\nsudo yast2 language &\nfrom a command line.\nProcedure 5.1:\nInstalling additional languages\n#\nWhen installing additional languages, YaST also allows you to\n     set different locale settings for the user\nroot\n, see\nStep 4\n. The option\nLocale Settings for User root\ndetermines how\n     the locale variables (\nLC_*\n) in the file\n/etc/sysconfig/language\nare set for\nroot\n. You can set them to the same locale as for normal\n     users. Alternatively, you can keep it unaffected by any language\n     changes, or only set the variable\nRC_LC_CTYPE\nto\n     the same values as for the normal users. The\nRC_LC_CTYPE\nvariable sets the localization for\n     language-specific function calls.\nTo add languages in the YaST language module, select the\nSecondary Languages\nyou want to install.\nTo make a language the default language, set it as\nPrimary\n      Language\n.\nAdditionally, adapt the keyboard to the new primary language and adjust\n      the time zone, if appropriate.\nTip: Advanced settings\nFor advanced keyboard or time zone settings, select\nHardware\n›\nSystem Keyboard Layout\nor\nSystem\n›\nDate\n       and Time\nin YaST to start the respective\n       dialogs. For more information, refer to\nChapter 32,\nSetting up your system keyboard layout\nand\nSection 5.2, “Changing the country and time settings”\n.\nTo change language settings specific to the user\nroot\n, click\nDetails\n.\nSet\nLocale Settings for User root\nto the desired\n        value. For more information, click\nHelp\n.\nDecide if you want to\nUse UTF-8 Encoding\nfor\nroot\nor not.\nIf your locale was not included in the list of primary languages\n      available, try specifying it with\nDetailed Locale\n      Setting\n. However, some localization may be incomplete.\nConfirm your changes in the dialogs with\nOK\n. If you\n      have selected secondary languages, YaST installs the localized software\n      packages for the additional languages.\nThe system is now multilingual. However, to start an application in a\n    language other than the primary one, you need to set the desired language\n    explicitly as explained in\nSection 5.1.3, “Switching languages for standard X and GNOME applications”\n.\n5.1.2\nSwitching the default system language\n#\nTo globally change the default language of a system, use the following procedure:\nStart the YaST language module.\nSelect the desired new system language as\nPrimary\n      Language\n.\nImportant: Deleting former system languages\nIf you switch to a different primary language, the localized software\n       packages for the former primary language will be removed from the\n       system. To switch the default system language but keep the former\n       primary language as an additional language, add it as\nSecondary\n       Language\nby selecting the respective check box.\nAdjust the keyboard and time zone options as desired.\nConfirm your changes with\nOK\n.\nAfter YaST has applied the changes, restart current X sessions (for\n      example, by logging out and logging in again) to make YaST and the\n      desktop applications reflect your new language settings.\n5.1.3\nSwitching languages for standard X and GNOME applications\n#\nAfter you have installed the respective language with YaST, you can run a\n    single application in another language.\nStart the application from the command line by using the following command:\nLANG=\nLANGUAGE\napplication\nFor example, to start f-spot in German, run\nLANG=de_DE f-spot\n. For other languages, use the\n    appropriate language code. Get a list of all language codes available with\n    the\nlocale\n-av\ncommand.\n5.2\nChanging the country and time settings\n#\nUsing the YaST date and time module, adjust your system date, clock and\n   time zone information to the area you are working in. To access the YaST\n   module, start YaST and click\nSystem\n›\nDate and Time\n. Alternatively, start the\nClock and Time Zone\ndialog directly by running\nsudo yast2 timezone &\nfrom a command line.\nFirst, select a general region, such as\nEurope\n. Choose an\n   appropriate country that matches the one you are working in, for example,\nGermany\n.\nDepending on which operating systems run on your workstation, adjust the\n   hardware clock settings accordingly:\nIf you run another operating system on your machine, such as Microsoft\n     Windows*, it is likely your system does not use UTC, but local time. In\n     this case, deactivate\nHardware Clock Set To UTC\n.\nIf you only run Linux on your machine, set the hardware clock to UTC and\n     have the switch from standard time to daylight saving time performed\n     automatically.\nImportant: Set the hardware clock to UTC\nThe switch from standard time to daylight saving time (and vice versa) can\n    only be performed automatically when the hardware clock (CMOS clock) is set\n    to UTC. This also applies if you use automatic time synchronization with\n    NTP, because automatic synchronization will only be performed if the time\n    difference between the hardware and system clock is less than 15 minutes.\nSince a wrong system time can cause serious problems (missed backups,\n    dropped mail messages, mount failures on remote file systems, etc.) it is\n    strongly recommended to\nalways\nset the hardware clock\n    to UTC.\nYou can change the date and time manually or opt for synchronizing your\n   machine against an NTP server, either permanently or only for adjusting your\n   hardware clock.\nProcedure 5.2:\nManually adjusting time and date\n#\nIn the YaST timezone module, click\nOther Settings\nto\n     set date and time.\nSelect\nManually\nand enter date and time values.\nConfirm your changes.\nProcedure 5.3:\nSetting date and time with NTP server\n#\nClick\nOther Settings\nto set date and time.\nSelect\nSynchronize with NTP Server\n.\nEnter the address of an NTP server, if not already populated.\nWith the\nConfigure\nbutton, you can open the advanced\n     NTP configuration. For details, see\nSection 38.1, “Configuring an NTP client with YaST”\n.\nConfirm your changes.\nOn this page\n5.1\nChanging the system language\n5.2\nChanging the country and time settings\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

It also lets you configure your system\n  to authenticate users with a network server.\n6.1\nUser and group administration dialog\n#\nTo administer users or groups, start YaST and click\nSecurity and Users\n›\nUser and Group\n   Management\n. Alternatively, start the\nUser\n   and Group Administration\ndialog directly by running\nsudo\n   yast2 users &\nfrom a command line.\nFigure 6.1:\nYaST user and group administration\n#\nEvery user is assigned a system-wide user ID (UID). Apart from the users\n   that can log in to your machine, there are also several\nsystem\n   users\nfor internal use only. Each user is assigned to one or more\n   groups. Similar to\nsystem users\n, there are also\nsystem groups\nfor internal use.\nDepending on the set of users you choose to view and modify, the dialog\n   (local users, network users, system users), the main window shows several\n   tabs. These allow you to execute the following tasks:\nManaging user accounts\nFrom the\nUsers\ntab create, modify, delete or\n      temporarily disable user accounts as described in\nSection 6.2, “Managing user accounts”\n. Learn about advanced options like\n      enforcing password policies, using encrypted home directories, or\n      managing disk quotas in\nSection 6.3, “Additional options for user accounts”\n.\nChanging default settings\nLocal user accounts are created according to the settings defined on the\nDefaults for New Users\ntab. Learn how to change the\n      default group assignment, or the default path and access permissions for\n      home directories in\nSection 6.4, “Changing default settings for local users”\n.\nAssigning users to groups\nLearn how to change the group assignment for individual users in\nSection 6.5, “Assigning users to groups”\n.\nManaging groups\nFrom the\nGroups\ntab, you can add, modify, or delete\n      existing groups. Refer to\nSection 6.6, “Managing groups”\nfor\n      information on how to do this.\nChanging the user authentication method\nWhen your machine is connected to a network that provides user\n      authentication methods like NIS or LDAP, you can choose between several\n      authentication methods on the\nAuthentication Settings\ntab. For more information, refer to\nSection 6.7, “Changing the user authentication method”\n.\nFor user and group management, the dialog provides similar functionality.\n   You can easily switch between the user and group administration view by\n   choosing the appropriate tab at the top of the dialog.\nFilter options allow you to define the set of users or groups you want to\n   modify: On the\nUsers\nor\nGroup\ntab,\n   click\nSet Filter\nto view and edit users or groups.\n   They are listed according to certain categories, such as\nLocal Users\nor\nLDAP Users\n, if applicable. With\nSet Filter\n›\nCustomize Filter\nyou can also set up and\n   use a custom filter.\nDepending on the filter you choose, not all of the following options and\n   functions will be available from the dialog.\n6.2\nManaging user accounts\n#\nYaST lets you create, modify, delete or temporarily disable\n   user accounts. Do not modify user accounts unless you are an experienced\n   user or administrator.\nNote: Changing user IDs of existing users\nFile ownership is bound to the user ID, not to the user name. After a user\n    ID change, the files in the user's home directory are automatically\n    adjusted to reflect this change. However, after an ID change, the user no\n    longer owns the files they created elsewhere in the file system unless the\n    file ownership for those files is manually modified.\nIn the following, learn how to set up default user accounts. For further\n   options, refer to\nSection 6.3, “Additional options for user accounts”\n.\nProcedure 6.1:\nAdding or modifying user accounts\n#\nOpen the YaST\nUser and Group Administration\ndialog\n     and click the\nUsers\ntab.\nWith\nSet Filter\ndefine the set of users you want to\n     manage. The dialog lists users in the system and the groups the users\n     belong to.\nTo modify options for an existing user, select an entry and click\nEdit\n.\nTo create a new user account, click\nAdd\n.\nEnter the appropriate user data on the first tab, such as\nUsername\n(which is used for login) and\nPassword\n. This data is sufficient to create a new user.\n     If you click\nOK\nnow, the system will automatically\n     assign a user ID and set all other values according to the default.\nActivate\nReceive System Mail\nif you want any kind of\n     system notifications to be delivered to this user's mailbox. This creates\n     a mail alias for\nroot\nand the user can read the system mail without\n     having to first log in as\nroot\n.\nThe mails sent by system services are stored in the local mailbox\n/var/spool/mail/\nUSERNAME\n,\n     where\nUSERNAME\nis the login name of the\n     selected user. To read e-mails, you can use the\nmail\ncommand.\nTo adjust further details such as the user ID or the path to\n     the user's home directory, do so on the\nDetails\ntab.\nIf you need to relocate the home directory of an existing user, enter the\n     path to the new home directory there and move the contents of the current\n     home directory with\nMove to New Location\n. Otherwise, a\n     new home directory is created without any of the existing data.\nTo force users to regularly change their password or set other password\n     options, switch to\nPassword Settings\nand adjust the\n     options. For more details, refer to\nSection 6.3.2, “Enforcing password policies”\n.\nIf all options are set according to your wishes, click\nOK\n.\nClick\nOK\nto close the administration dialog and to save\n     the changes. A newly added user can now log in to the system using the\n     login name and password you created.\nAlternatively, to save all changes without exiting the\nUser and Group Administration\ndialog, click\nExpert Options\n›\nWrite Changes\n     Now\n.\nWarning: Do not rename the\nroot\naccount\nWhile it is technically possible to rename the\nroot\naccount, certain applications,\n      scripts or third-party products may rely on the existence of a user called\nroot\n. While\n      such a configuration always targets individual environments, necessary adjustments could be\n      overwritten by vendor updates, so this becomes an ongoing task, not a one-time setting.\n      This is especially true in very complex setups involving third-party applications, where it needs to be verified\n      with every involved vendor whether a rename of the\nroot\naccount is supported.\nAs the implications for renaming the\nroot\naccount cannot be foreseen, SUSE does not\n      support renaming the\nroot\naccount.\nUsually, the idea behind renaming the\nroot\naccount is to hide it or make it unpredictable.\n      However,\n/etc/passwd\nrequires\n644\npermissions for\n      regular users, so any user of the system can retrieve the login name for the\n      user ID 0.\nFor better ways to secure the\nroot\naccount, refer to\nSection 14.5, “Restricting\nroot\nlogins”\nand\nSection 14.5.3, “Restricting SSH logins”\n.\nTip: Matching user IDs\nIt is useful to match the (local) user ID to the ID in the network.\n    For example, a new (local) user on a laptop should be integrated into a\n    network environment with the same user ID. This ensures that the\n    file ownership of the files the user creates\n“\noffline\n”\nis the\n    same as if they had created them directly on the network.\nProcedure 6.2:\nDisabling or deleting user accounts\n#\nOpen the YaST\nUser and Group Administration\ndialog\n     and click the\nUsers\ntab.\nTo temporarily disable a user account without deleting it, select the user\n     from the list and click\nEdit\n. Activate\nDisable\n     User Login\n. The user cannot log in to your machine until you\n     enable the account again.\nTo delete a user account, select the user from the list and click\nDelete\n. Choose if you also want to delete the user's\n     home directory or to retain the data.\n6.3\nAdditional options for user accounts\n#\nIn addition to the settings for a default user account,\nSUSE® Linux Enterprise Server\noffers further options. For example, options to enforce password policies, use\n   encrypted home directories or define disk quotas for users and groups.\n6.3.1\nAutomatic login and passwordless login\n#\nIf you use the GNOME desktop environment you can configure\nAuto\n    Login\nfor a certain user and\nPasswordless\n    Login\nfor all users. Auto login causes a user to become\n    automatically logged in to the desktop environment on boot. This\n    functionality can only be activated for one user at a time. Login without\n    password allows all users to log in to the system after they have entered\n    their user name in the login manager.\nWarning: Security risk\nEnabling\nAuto Login\nor\nPasswordless\n     Login\non a machine that can be accessed by more than one person\n     is a security risk. Without the need to authenticate, any user can gain\n     access to your system and your data. If your system contains confidential\n     data, do not use this functionality.\nTo activate auto login or login without password, access these\n    functions in the YaST\nUser and Group Administration\nwith\nExpert Options\n›\nLogin\n    Settings\n.\n6.3.2\nEnforcing password policies\n#\nOn any system with multiple users, it is a good idea to enforce at least\n    basic password security policies. Users should change their passwords\n    regularly and use strong passwords that cannot easily be exploited. For\n    local users, proceed as follows:\nProcedure 6.3:\nConfiguring password settings\n#\nOpen the YaST\nUser and Group Administration\ndialog\n      and select the\nUsers\ntab.\nSelect the user for which to change the password options and click\nEdit\n.\nSwitch to the\nPassword Settings\ntab. The user's last\n      password change is displayed on the tab.\nTo make the user change their password at next login, activate\nForce Password Change\n.\nTo enforce password rotation, set a\nMaximum Number of Days for\n      the Same Password\nand a\nMinimum Number of Days for the\n      Same Password\n.\nTo remind the user to change their password before it expires, set the\n      number of\nDays before Password Expiration to Issue\n      Warning\n.\nTo restrict the period of time the user can log in after their password has\n      expired, change the value in\nDays after Password Expires with\n      Usable Login\n.\nYou can also specify a certain expiration date for the complete account.\n      Enter the\nExpiration Date\nin\nYYYY-MM-DD\nformat. Note that this setting is\n      not password-related but rather applies to the account itself.\nFor more information about the options and about the default values,\n      click\nHelp\n.\nApply your changes with\nOK\n.\n6.3.3\nManaging quotas\n#\nTo prevent system capacities from being exhausted without notification,\n    system administrators can set up quotas for users or groups. Quotas can be\n    defined for one or more file systems and restrict the amount of disk space\n    that can be used and the number of inodes (index nodes) that can be created\n    there. Inodes are data structures on a file system that store basic\n    information about a regular file, directory, or other file system object.\n    They store all attributes of a file system object (like user and group\n    ownership, read, write, or execute permissions), except file name and\n    contents.\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nallows usage of\nsoft\nand\nhard\nquotas. Additionally, grace intervals can be\n    defined that allow users or groups to temporarily violate their quotas by\n    certain amounts.\nSoft quota\nDefines a warning level at which users are informed that they are\n       nearing their limit. Administrators will urge the users to clean up and\n       reduce their data on the partition. The soft quota limit is usually\n       lower than the hard quota limit.\nHard quota\nDefines the limit at which write requests are denied. When the hard\n       quota is reached, no more data can be stored and applications may crash.\nGrace period\nDefines the time between the overflow of the soft quota and a warning\n       being issued. Usually set to a rather low value of one or several hours.\nProcedure 6.4:\nEnabling quota support for a partition\n#\nTo configure quotas for certain users and groups, you need to enable quota\n     support for the respective partition in the YaST Expert Partitioner\n     first.\nNote: Quotas for Btrfs partitions\nQuotas for Btrfs partitions are handled differently. For more\n      information, see\nSection 1.2.5, “Btrfs quota support for subvolumes”\n.\nIn YaST, select\nSystem\n›\nPartitioner\nand click\nYes\nto proceed.\nIn the\nExpert Partitioner\n, select the partition for\n      which to enable quotas and click\nEdit\n.\nClick\nFstab Options\nand activate\nEnable Quota\n      Support\n. If the\nquota\npackage is not\n      already installed, it will be installed when you confirm the respective\n      message with\nYes\n.\nConfirm your changes and leave the\nExpert Partitioner\n.\nMake sure the service\nquotaon\nis\n      running by entering the following command:\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl status quotaon.service\nIt should be marked as being\nactive\n. If this is not\n      the case, start it with the command\nsystemctl start\n      quotaon.service\n.\nProcedure 6.5:\nSetting up quotas for users or groups\n#\nNow you can define soft or hard quotas for specific users or groups and\n     set time periods as grace intervals.\nIn the YaST\nUser and Group Administration\n, select\n      the user or the group you want to set the quotas for and click\nEdit\n.\nOn the\nPlug-Ins\ntab, select the\nManage User\n      Quota\nentry and click\nLaunch\nto open the\nQuota Configuration\ndialog.\nFrom\nFile System\n, select the partition to which the\n      quota should apply.\nBelow\nSize Limits\n, restrict the amount of disk space.\n      Enter the number of 1 KB blocks the user or group may have on this\n      partition. Specify a\nSoft Limit\nand a\nHard\n      Limit\nvalue.\nAdditionally, you can restrict the number of inodes the user or group may\n      have on the partition. Below\nInodes Limits\n, enter a\nSoft Limit\nand\nHard Limit\n.\nYou can only define grace intervals if the user or group has already\n      exceeded the soft limit specified for size or inodes. Otherwise, the\n      time-related text boxes are not activated. Specify the time period for\n      which the user or group is allowed to exceed the limits set above.\nConfirm your settings with\nOK\n.\nClick\nOK\nto close the administration dialog and save\n      the changes.\nAlternatively, to save all changes without exiting the\nUser and Group Administration\ndialog, click\nExpert Options\n›\nWrite Changes\n      Now\n.\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nalso ships command line tools like\nrepquota\nor\nwarnquota\n. System\n    administrators can use these tools to control the disk usage or send e-mail\n    notifications to users exceeding their quota. Using\nquota_nld\n, administrators can also forward kernel\n    messages about exceeded quotas to D-BUS. For more information, refer to the\nrepquota\n, the\nwarnquota\nand the\nquota_nld\nman page.\n6.4\nChanging default settings for local users\n#\nWhen creating new local users, several default settings are used by YaST.\n    These include, for example, the group the user belongs to, or the access\n    permissions of the user's home directory. You can change these default\n    settings to meet your requirements:\nOpen the YaST\nUser and Group Administration\ndialog\n     and select the\nDefaults for New Users\ntab.\nTo change the group the new users should automatically belong to,\n     select another group from\nDefault Group\n.\nIf you do not want to use\n/home/\nUSERNAME\nas the default\n     path for new users' home directories, modify the\nPath Prefix for\n     Home Directory\n.\nTo change the default permission modes for newly created home directories,\n     adjust the umask value in\nUmask for Home Directory\n. For\n     more information about umask, refer to\nChapter 19,\nAccess control lists in Linux\nand to the\numask\nman page.\nFor information about the individual options, click\nHelp\n.\nApply your changes with\nOK\n.\n6.5\nAssigning users to groups\n#\nLocal users are assigned to several groups according to the\n   default settings, which you can access from the\nUser and Group\n   Administration\ndialog on the\nDefaults for New\n   Users\ntab. In the following, learn how to modify an individual\n   user's group assignment. If you need to change the default group assignments\n   for new users, refer to\nSection 6.4, “Changing default settings for local users”\n.\nProcedure 6.6:\nChanging a user's group assignment\n#\nOpen the YaST\nUser and Group Administration\ndialog\n     and click the\nUsers\ntab. It lists users and the\n     groups the users belong to.\nClick\nEdit\nand switch to the\nDetails\ntab.\nTo change the group the user belongs to, click\nDefault\n     Group\nand select the group from the list.\nTo assign the user additional secondary groups, activate the corresponding\n     check boxes in the\nAdditional Groups\nlist.\nClick\nOK\nto apply your changes.\nClick\nOK\nto close the administration dialog and save\n     the changes.\nAlternatively, to save all changes without exiting the\nUser and Group Administration\ndialog, click\nExpert Options\n›\nWrite Changes\n     Now\n.\n6.6\nManaging groups\n#\nWith YaST you can also easily add, modify, or delete groups.\nProcedure 6.7:\nCreating and modifying groups\n#\nOpen the YaST\nUser and Group Management\ndialog and\n     click the\nGroups\ntab.\nWith\nSet Filter\ndefine the set of groups you want to\n     manage. The dialog lists groups in the system.\nTo create a new group, click\nAdd\n.\nTo modify an existing group, select the group and click\nEdit\n.\nIn the following dialog, enter or change the data. The list on the right\n     shows an overview of all available users and system users which can be\n     members of the group.\nTo add existing users to a new group select them from the list of possible\nGroup Members\nby checking the corresponding box. To\n     remove them from the group deactivate the box.\nClick\nOK\nto apply your changes.\nClick\nOK\nto close the administration dialog and save\n     the changes.\nAlternatively, to save all changes without exiting the\nUser and Group Administration\ndialog, click\nExpert Options\n›\nWrite Changes\n     Now\n.\nTo delete a group, it must not contain any group members. To delete a group,\n   select it from the list and click\nDelete\n. Click\nOK\nto close the administration dialog and save the\n   changes. Alternatively, to save all changes without exiting the\nUser and Group Administration\ndialog, click\nExpert Options\n›\nWrite Changes Now\n.\n6.7\nChanging the user authentication method\n#\nWhen your machine is connected to a network, you can change the\n   authentication method. The following options are available:\nNIS\nUsers are administered centrally on a NIS server for all systems\n      in the network. For details, see\nChapter 3,\nUsing NIS\n.\nSSSD\nThe\nSystem Security Services Daemon\n(SSSD)\n      can locally cache user data  and then allow users to use the\n      data, even if the real directory service is (temporarily)\n      unreachable. For details, see\nSection 4.2, “SSSD”\n.\nSamba\nSMB authentication is often used in mixed Linux and Windows\n      networks. For details, see\nChapter 20,\nSamba\n.\nTo change the authentication method, proceed as follows:\nOpen the\nUser and Group Administration\ndialog in\n     YaST.\nClick the\nAuthentication Settings\ntab to show an\n     overview of the available authentication methods and the current settings.\nTo change the authentication method, click\nConfigure\nand select the authentication method you want to modify. This takes you\n     directly to the client configuration modules in YaST. For information\n     about the configuration of the appropriate client, refer to the following\n     sections:\nNIS:\nSection 3.2, “Configuring NIS clients”\nLDAP:\nSection 4.1, “Configuring an authentication client with YaST”\nSamba:\nSection 20.5.1, “Configuring a Samba client with YaST”\nSSSD:\nSection 4.2, “SSSD”\nAfter accepting the configuration, return to the\nUser and Group\n     Administration\noverview.\nClick\nOK\nto close the administration dialog.\n6.8\nDefault system users\n#\nBy default,\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\ncreates user names, which cannot be deleted. These\n   users are typically defined in the Linux Standard Base (see\nhttps://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/lsb.shtml\n).  The\n   following list provides the common user names and their purpose:\nCommon user names installed by default\n#\nbin\n,\ndaemon\nLegacy user, included for compatibility with legacy applications. New\n      applications should no longer use this user name.\ngdm\nUsed by GNOME Display Manager (GDM) to provide graphical logins and\n      manage local and remote displays.\nlp\nUsed by the Printer daemon for Common Unix Printing System (CUPS).\nmail\nUser reserved for mailer programs like\nsendmail\nor\npostfix\n.\nman\nUsed by man to access man pages.\nmessagebus\nUsed to access D-Bus (desktop bus), a software bus for inter-process\n      communication. Daemon is\ndbus-daemon\n.\nnobody\nUser that owns no files and is in no privileged groups. Nowadays,\n      its use is limited as it is recommended by Linux Standard Base to provide\n      a separate user account for each daemon.\nnscd\nUsed by the Name Service Caching Daemon. This daemon is a lookup\n      service to improve performance with NIS and LDAP.\n      Daemon is\nnscd\n.\npolkitd\nUsed by the PolicyKit Authorization Framework, which defines and\n      handles authorization requests for unprivileged processes.\n      Daemon is\npolkitd\n.\npostfix\nUsed by the Postfix mailer.\npulse\nUsed by the Pulseaudio sound server.\nroot\nUsed by the system administrator, providing all appropriate privileges.\nrpc\nUsed by the\nrpcbind\ncommand, an RPC\n      port mapper.\nrtkit\nUsed by the\nrtkit\npackage providing a\n      D-Bus system service for real time scheduling mode.\nsalt\nUser for parallel remote execution provided by Salt.

By default, the update applet is used to keep your system\n  up to date. Refer to\nSection 8.5, “The GNOME package updater”\nfor further information on\n  the update applet. This chapter covers the alternative tool for updating\n  software packages: YaST Online Update.\nThe current patches for\nSUSE® Linux Enterprise Server\nare available from an update\n  software repository.\nIf you have\n  registered your product during the installation, an update repository is\n  already configured. If you have not registered\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n, you can do so\n  by starting the\nProduct Registration\nin YaST.\nAlternatively, you can manually add an update repository from a source you\n  trust. To add or remove repositories, start the Repository Manager with\nSoftware\n›\nSoftware Repositories\nin YaST. Learn more\n  about the Repository Manager in\nSection 8.4, “Managing software repositories and services”\n.\nNote: Error on accessing the update catalog\nIf you are not able to access the update catalog, this might be because of\n   an expired subscription. Normally,\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\ncomes with a one-year or\n   three-year subscription, during which you have access to the update catalog.\n   This access will be denied after the subscription ends.\nIf an access to the update catalog is denied, you will see a warning\n   message prompting you to visit the SUSE Customer Center and check your\n   subscription. The SUSE Customer Center is available at\nhttps://scc.suse.com//\n.\nNote: Firewall settings for receiving updates\nBy default, the firewall on\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nonly blocks incoming connections.\n  If your system is behind another firewall that blocks outgoing traffic,\n  make sure to allow connections to\nhttps://scc.suse.com/\nand\nhttps://updates.suse.com\non ports 80 and 443 in order\n  to receive updates.\nSUSE provides updates with different relevance levels:\nSecurity updates\nFix severe security hazards and should always be installed.\nRecommended updates\nFix issues that could compromise your computer.\nOptional updates\nFix non-security relevant issues or provide enhancements.\n7.1\nThe online update dialog\n#\nTo open the YaST\nOnline Update\ndialog, start YaST and\n   select\nSoftware\n›\nOnline\n   Update\n. Alternatively, start it from the command\n   line with\nyast2 online_update\n.\nThe\nOnline Update\nwindow consists of four sections.\nFigure 7.1:\nYaST online update\n#\nThe\nSummary\nsection on the left lists the available\n   patches for\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n. The patches are sorted by security relevance:\nsecurity\n,\nrecommended\n, and\noptional\n. You can change the view of the\nSummary\nsection by selecting one of the following options\n   from\nShow Patch Category\n:\nNeeded patches\n(default view)\nNon-installed patches that apply to packages installed on your system.\nUnneeded patches\nPatches that either apply to packages not installed on your system, or\n      patches that have requirements which have already have been fulfilled\n      (because the relevant packages have already been updated from another\n      source).\nAll patches\nAll patches available for\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n.\nEach list entry in the\nSummary\nsection consists of a\n   symbol and the patch name. For an overview of the possible symbols and their\n   meaning, press\nShift\n–\nF1\n. Actions required by\nSecurity\nand\nRecommended\npatches are automatically preset. These\n   actions are\nAutoinstall\n,\nAutoupdate\nand\nAutodelete\n.\nIf you install an up-to-date package from a repository other than the update\n   repository, the requirements of a patch for this package may be fulfilled\n   with this installation. In this case a check mark is displayed in front of\n   the patch summary. The patch will be visible in the list until you mark it\n   for installation. This will in fact not install the patch (because the\n   package already is up to date), but mark the patch as having been installed.\nSelect an entry in the\nSummary\nsection to view a short\nPatch Description\nat the bottom left corner of the\n   dialog. The upper right section lists the packages included in the selected\n   patch (a patch can consist of several packages). Click an entry in the upper\n   right section to view details about the respective package that is included\n   in the patch.\n7.2\nInstalling patches\n#\nThe YaST Online Update dialog allows you to either install all available\n   patches at once or manually select the desired patches. You may also revert patches that have been applied to the\n   system.\nBy default, all new patches (except\noptional\nones) that\n   are currently available for your system are already marked for installation.\n   They will be applied automatically once you click\nAccept\nor\nApply\n.\n\n   If one or multiple patches require a system reboot, you will be notified\n   about this before the patch installation starts. You can then either decide\n   to continue with the installation of the selected patches, skip the\n   installation of all patches that need rebooting and install the rest, or go\n   back to the manual patch selection.\nProcedure 7.1:\nApplying patches with YaST online update\n#\nStart YaST and select\nSoftware\n›\nOnline Update\n.\nTo automatically apply all new patches (except\noptional\nones) that are currently available for your system, click\nApply\nor\nAccept\n.\nFirst modify the selection of patches that you want to apply:\nUse the respective filters and views that the interface provides. For\n       details, refer to\nSection 7.1, “The online update dialog”\n.\nSelect or deselect patches according to your needs and wishes by\n       right-clicking the patch and choosing the respective action from the\n       context menu.\nImportant: Always apply security updates\nDo not deselect any\nsecurity\n-related patches without\n        a very good reason. These patches fix severe security hazards and\n        prevent your system from being exploited.\nMost patches include updates for several packages. To change\n       actions for single packages, right-click a package in the package view\n       and choose an action.\nTo confirm your selection and apply the selected patches, proceed with\nApply\nor\nAccept\n.\nAfter the installation is complete, click\nFinish\nto\n     leave the YaST\nOnline Update\n. Your system is now\n     up to date.\n7.3\nViewing retracted patches\n#\nMaintenance updates are carefully tested to minimize the risk\n    of introducing a bug. If a patch proves to contain a bug, it is\n    automatically retracted. A new update (with a higher version number) is \n    issued to revert the buggy patch, and is blocked from being installed \n    again. You can see retracted patches, and their history, on the\nPackage Classification\ntab.\nFigure 7.2:\nViewing retracted patches and history\n#\n7.4\nAutomatic online update\n#\nYou may configure automatic updates with a daily, weekly, or \n   monthly schedule with YaST. Install the\nyast2-online-update-configuration\npackage.\nBy default, updates are downloaded as delta RPMs. Since rebuilding RPM\n   packages from delta RPMs is a memory- and processor-intensive task, certain\n   setups or hardware configurations might require you to disable the use of\n   delta RPMs for the sake of performance.\nSome patches, such as kernel updates or packages requiring license\n   agreements, require user interaction, which would cause the automatic update\n   procedure to stop. You can configure skipping patches that require user\n   interaction.\nUse the\nPatches\ntab in the YaST\nSoftware\nmodule to review available and installed\n      patches, including references to bug reports and CVE bulletins.\nProcedure 7.2:\nConfiguring the automatic online update\n#\nAfter installation, start YaST and select\nSoftware\n›\nOnline Update\n. Choose\nConfiguration\n›\nOnline Update\n. If the\nyast2-online-update-configuration\nis not installed, you\n     will be prompted to do that.\nFigure 7.3:\nYaST online update configuration\n#\nAlternatively, start the module with\nyast2 online_update_configuration\nfrom the command\n     line.\nChoose the update interval:\nDaily\n,\nWeekly\n, or\nMonthly\n.\nSometimes patches may require the attention of the administrator, for\n     example when restarting critical services. For example, this might be an\n     update for Docker Open Source Engine that requires all containers to be restarted. Before\n     these\n     patches are installed, the user is informed about the consequences and is\n     asked to confirm the installation of the patch. Such patches are called\n“\nInteractive Patches\n”\n.\nWhen installing patches automatically, it is assumed that you have\n     accepted the installation of interactive patches. If you prefer to\n     review these patches before they get installed, check\nSkip\n     Interactive Patches\n. In this case, interactive patches will be\n     skipped during automated patching. Make sure to periodically run a manual\n     online update, to check whether interactive patches are waiting to be\n     installed.\nTo automatically accept any license agreements, activate\nAgree\n     with Licenses\n.\nTo automatically install all packages recommended by updated packages,\n     activate\nInclude Recommended Packages\n.\nTo disable the use of delta RPMs (for performance reasons), un-check\nUse Delta RPMs\n.\nTo filter the patches by category (such as security or recommended),\n     check\nFilter by Category\nand add the appropriate\n     patch categories from the list. Only patches of the selected categories\n     will be installed. It is a good practice to enable only automatic\nSecurity\nupdates, and to manually review all others.\n     Patching is usually reliable, but you may wish to test non-security\n     patches, and roll them back if you encounter any problems.\nPackagemanager and YaST\nsupply patches\n                for package management and YaST features and modules.\nSecurity\npatches provide crucial\n                updates and bugfixes.\nRecommended\npatches are optional\n                bugfixes and enhancements.\nOptional\nare new packages.\nOther\nis equivalent to miscellaneous.\nDocument\nis unused.\nConfirm your configuration by clicking\nOK\n.\nThe automatic online update does not automatically restart the system\n   afterward. If there are package updates that require a system reboot, you\n   need to do this manually.\nOn this page\n7.1\nThe online update dialog\n7.2\nInstalling patches\n7.3\nViewing retracted patches\n7.4\nAutomatic online update\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

YaST resolves all dependencies for you. To\n    install packages not shipped with the installation media, add\n    software repositories to your setup and let YaST manage them. Keep your\n    system up-to-date by managing software updates with the update applet.\nChange the software collection of your system with the YaST Software\n  Manager. This YaST module is available in two flavors: a graphical variant\n  for X Window and a text-based variant to be used on the command line. The\n  graphical flavor is described here—for details on the text-based\n  YaST, see\nChapter 4,\nYaST in text mode\n.\nNote: Confirmation and review of changes\nWhen installing, updating, or removing packages, any changes in the Software\n   Manager are only applied after clicking\nAccept\nor\nApply\n. YaST maintains a list with all actions, allowing\n   you to review and modify your changes before applying them to the system.\n8.1\nDefinition of terms\n#\nThe following terms are important for understanding installing and removing\n   software in\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n.\nRepository\nA local or remote directory containing packages, plus additional\n      information about these packages (package metadata).\n(Repository) alias/repository name\nA short name for a repository (called\nAlias\nwithin\n      Zypper and\nRepository Name\nwithin YaST). It can be\n      chosen by the user when adding a repository and must be unique.\nRepository description files\nEach repository provides files describing content of the repository\n      (package names, versions, etc.). These repository description files are\n      downloaded to a local cache that is used by YaST.\nProduct\nRepresents a whole product, for example\nSUSE® Linux Enterprise Server\n.\nPattern\nA pattern is an installable group of packages dedicated to a certain\n      purpose. For example, the\nLaptop\npattern\n      contains all packages that are needed in a mobile computing environment.\n      Patterns define package dependencies (such as required or recommended\n      packages) and come with a preselection of packages marked for\n      installation. This ensures that the most important packages needed for a\n      certain purpose are available on your system after installation of the\n      pattern. If necessary, you can manually select or deselect\n      packages within a pattern.\nPackage\nA package is a compressed file in\nrpm\nformat that\n      contains the files for a particular program.\nPatch\nA fix or compilation of fixes released by SUSE to correct operation\n       defects (program bugs) in SUSE products. A patch can contain one or\n       multiple files to replace or enhance existing executables, programs,\n       applications or documents.\nA patch consists of one or more packages and may be applied by delta RPMs.\n      It may also introduce dependencies to packages that are not installed yet.\nResolvable\nA generic term for product, pattern, package, or patch. The most commonly\n      used type of resolvable is a package or a patch.\nDelta RPM\nA delta RPM consists only of the binary diff between two defined versions\n      of a package, and therefore has the smallest download size. Before being\n      installed, the full RPM package is rebuilt on the local machine.\nPackage dependencies\nCertain packages are dependent on other packages, such as shared\n      libraries. In other terms, a package may\nrequire\nother\n      packages—if the required packages are not available, the package\n      cannot be installed. In addition to dependencies (package requirements)\n      that must be fulfilled, some packages\nrecommend\nother\n      packages. These recommended packages are only installed if they are\n      actually available, otherwise they are ignored and the package\n      recommending them is installed nevertheless.\n8.2\nRegistering an installed system\n#\nIf you skipped registration during installation or want to re-register your\n   system, you can register the system at any time. Use the YaST module\nProduct Registration\nor the command line tool\nSUSEConnect\n.\n8.2.1\nRegistering with YaST\n#\nTo register the system, start YaST and switch to\nSoftware\n, then\nProduct\n    Registration\n.\nBy default the system is registered with the SUSE Customer Center. If your\n    organization provides local registration servers, you can either\n    choose one from the list of auto-detected servers or provide the\n    URL manually.\n8.2.2\nRegistering with SUSEConnect\n#\nTo register from the command line, use the command\n>\nsudo\nSUSEConnect -r\nREGISTRATION_CODE\n-e\nEMAIL_ADDRESS\nReplace\nREGISTRATION_CODE\nwith the registration\n    code you received with your copy of\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n.\n    Replace\nEMAIL_ADDRESS\nwith\n    the e-mail address associated with the SUSE account you or your\n    organization uses to manage subscriptions.\nTo register with a local registration server, also provide the URL to\n    the server:\n>\nsudo\nSUSEConnect -r\nREGISTRATION_CODE\n-e\nEMAIL_ADDRESS\n--url \"\nURL\n\"\n8.3\nUsing the YaST software manager\n#\nStart the software manager from the\nYaST Control Center\nby choosing\nSoftware\n›\nSoftware\n   Management\n.\n8.3.1\nSearching software\n#\nThe YaST software manager can install packages or patterns from all\n    currently enabled repositories. It offers different views and filters to\n    make it easier to find the software you are searching for. The\nSearch\nview is the default view of the window. To change\n    view, click\nView\nand select one of the following entries\n    from the drop-down box. The selected view opens in a new tab.\nViews for searching packages or patterns\n#\nPatterns\nLists all patterns available for installation on your system.\nPackage Groups\nLists all packages sorted by groups such as\nGraphics\n,\nProgramming\n, or\nSecurity\n.\nLanguages\nA filter to list all packages needed to add a new system language.\nRepositories\nA filter to list packages by repository. To select more than one\n       repository, hold the\nCtrl\nkey while clicking\n       repository names. The\n“\npseudo repository\n”\n@System\nlists all packages currently installed.\nServices\nShows which packages belong to a certain module or extension. Select an\n       entry (for example,\nBasesystem\nor\nHigh\n       Availability\n) to display a list of packages that\n       belong to this module or extension.\nSearch\nLets you search for a package according to certain criteria. Enter a\n       search term and press\nEnter\n. Refine your search by\n       specifying where to\nSearch In\nand by changing the\nSearch Mode\n. For example, if you do not know the\n       package name but only the name of the application that you are searching\n       for, try including the package\nDescription\nin the\n       search process.\nInstallation Summary\nIf you have already selected packages for installation, update or\n       removal, this view shows the changes that will be applied to your system\n       when you click\nAccept\n. To filter for packages with a\n       certain status in this view, activate or deactivate the respective check\n       boxes. Press\nShift\n–\nF1\nfor details on the status flags.\nTip: Finding packages not belonging to an active repository\nTo list all packages that do not belong to an active repository, choose\nView\n›\nRepositories\n›\n@System\nand then choose\nSecondary Filter\n›\nUnmaintained\n     Packages\n. This is useful, for example, if you have\n     deleted a repository and want to make sure no packages from that\n     repository remain installed.\nTip: Searching software online\nThe online search feature allows searching for packages across all\n     registered and unregistered modules and extensions.\nProcedure 8.1:\nSearching software online\n#\nTo search for software packages online, perform the following steps:\nOpen the online search window with\nExtras\n›\nSearch Online\n.\nEnter a\nPackage Name\nand press\nEnter\nor click\nSearch\n.\n       YaST contacts the SUSE Customer Center and shows the results in a table, including the\n       module or extension of each package. Select a package to see additional\n       details.\nSelect one or more packages for installation by clicking the\n       corresponding table row and\nToggle Selection\n.\n       Alternatively, you can double-click a row. If the package belongs to\n       an unregistered module or extension, YaST asks for confirmation to\n       register it.\nClick\nNext\n, review the changes, and install the\n       packages.\n8.3.2\nInstalling and removing packages or patterns\n#\nCertain packages are dependent on other packages, such as shared libraries.\n    On the other hand, some packages cannot coexist with others on the system.\n    If possible, YaST automatically resolves these dependencies or conflicts.\n    If your choice results in a dependency conflict that cannot be\n    automatically solved, you need to solve it manually as described in\nSection 8.3.4, “Package dependencies”\n.\nNote: Removal of packages\nWhen removing any packages, by default YaST only removes the selected\n     packages. If you want YaST to also remove any other packages that become\n     unneeded after removal of the specified package, select\nOptions\n›\nCleanup when deleting\n     packages\nfrom the main menu.\nSearch for packages as described in\nSection 8.3.1, “Searching software”\n.\nThe packages found are listed in the right pane. To install a package or\n      remove it, right-click it and choose\nInstall\nor\nDelete\n. If the relevant option is not available, check\n      the package status indicated by the symbol in front of the package\n      name—press\nShift\n–\nF1\nfor help.\nTip: Applying an action to all packages listed\nTo apply an action to all packages listed in the right pane, go to the\n       main menu and choose an action from\nPackage\n›\nAll in This List\n.\nTo install a pattern, right-click the pattern name and choose\nInstall\n.\nIt is not possible to remove a pattern. Instead, select the\n      packages for the pattern you want to remove and mark them for removal.\nTo select more packages, repeat the steps mentioned above.\nBefore applying your changes, you can review or modify them by clicking\nView\n›\nInstallation\n      Summary\n. By default, all packages that will\n      change status are listed.\nTo revert the status for a package, right-click the package and\n      select one of the following entries:\nKeep\nif the\n      package was scheduled to be deleted or updated, or\nDo Not\n      Install\nif it was scheduled for installation. To abandon all\n      changes and quit the Software Manager, click\nCancel\nand\nAbandon\n.\nWhen you are finished, click\nAccept\nto apply your\n      changes.\nIn case YaST found dependencies on other packages, a list of packages\n      that have additionally been chosen for installation, update, or removal is\n      presented. Click\nContinue\nto accept them.\nAfter all selected packages are installed, updated, or removed, the YaST\n      Software Manager automatically closes.\nNote: Installing source packages\nInstalling source packages with YaST Software Manager is not possible at\n     the moment. Use the command line tool\nzypper\nfor this\n     purpose. For more information, see\nSection 9.1.3.5, “Installing or downloading source packages”\n.\n8.3.3\nUpdating packages\n#\nInstead of updating individual packages, you can also update all installed\n    packages or all packages from a certain repository. When mass updating\n    packages, the following aspects are generally considered:\npriorities of the repositories that provide the package,\narchitecture of the package (for example, AMD64/Intel 64),\nversion number of the package,\npackage vendor.\nWhich of the aspects has the highest importance for choosing the update\n    candidates depends on the respective update option you choose.\nTo update all installed packages to the latest version, choose\nPackage\n›\nAll Packages\n›\nUpdate if Newer Version Available\nfrom\n      the main menu.\nAll repositories are checked for possible update candidates, using the\n      following policy: YaST first tries to restrict the search to packages\n      with the same architecture and vendor as the installed one. If the\n      search is positive, the\n“\nbest\n”\nupdate candidate from those\n      is selected according to the process below. However, if no comparable\n      package of the same vendor can be found, the search is expanded to all\n      packages with the same architecture. If still no comparable package can\n      be found, all packages are considered and the\n“\nbest\n”\nupdate\n      candidate is selected according to the following criteria:\nRepository priority: Prefer the package from the repository with the\n        highest priority.\nIf more than one package results from this selection, choose the one\n        with the\n“\nbest\n”\narchitecture (best choice: matching the\n        architecture of the installed one).\nIf the resulting package has a higher version number than the installed\n      one, the installed package will be updated and replaced with the selected\n      update candidate.\nThis option tries to avoid changes in architecture and vendor for the\n      installed packages, but under certain circumstances, they are tolerated.\nNote: Update unconditionally\nIf you choose\nPackage\n›\nAll\n       Packages\n›\nUpdate Unconditionally\ninstead, the same criteria apply but any candidate package\n       found is installed unconditionally. Thus, choosing this option might\n       actually lead to downgrading some packages.\nTo make sure that the packages for a mass update derive from a certain\n      repository:\nChoose the repository from which to update as described in\nSection 8.3.1, “Searching software”\n.\nOn the right hand side of the window, click\nSwitch system\n        packages to the versions in this repository\n. This explicitly\n        allows YaST to change the package vendor when replacing the packages.\nWhen you proceed with\nAccept\n, all installed packages\n        will be replaced by packages deriving from this repository, if\n        available. This may lead to changes in vendor and architecture and even\n        to downgrading some packages.\nTo refrain from this, click\nCancel switching system packages\n        to the versions in this repository\n. Note that you can only\n        cancel this until you click the\nAccept\nbutton.\nBefore applying your changes, you can review or modify them by clicking\nView\n›\nInstallation\n      Summary\n. By default, all packages that will\n      change status, are listed.\nIf all options are set according to your wishes, confirm your changes\n      with\nAccept\nto start the mass update.\n8.3.4\nPackage dependencies\n#\nMost packages are dependent on other packages. If a package, for example,\n    uses a shared library, it is dependent on the package providing this\n    library. On the other hand, some packages cannot coexist,\n    causing a conflict (for example, you can only install one mail transfer\n    agent: sendmail or postfix). When installing or removing software, the\n    Software Manager makes sure no dependencies or conflicts remain unsolved to\n    ensure system integrity.\nIn case there exists only one solution to resolve a dependency or a\n    conflict, it is resolved automatically. Multiple solutions always cause a\n    conflict which needs to be resolved manually. If solving a conflict\n    involves a vendor or architecture change, it also needs to be solved\n    manually. When clicking\nAccept\nto apply any changes in\n    the Software Manager, you get an overview of all actions triggered by the\n    automatic resolver which you need to confirm.\nBy default, dependencies are automatically checked. A check is performed\n    every time you change a package status (for example, by marking a package\n    for installation or removal). This is generally useful, but can become\n    exhausting when manually resolving a dependency conflict. To disable this\n    function, go to the main menu and deactivate\nDependencies\n›\nAutocheck\n.\n    Manually perform a dependency check with\nDependencies\n›\nCheck Now\n.\n    A consistency check is always performed when you confirm your selection\n    with\nAccept\n.\nTo review a package's dependencies, right-click it and choose\nShow\n    Solver Information\n. A map showing the dependencies opens.\n    Packages that are already installed are displayed in a green frame.\nNote: Manually solving package conflicts\nUnless you are very experienced, follow the suggestions YaST makes when\n     handling package conflicts, otherwise you may not be able to resolve them.\n     Keep in mind that every change you make potentially triggers other\n     conflicts, so you can easily end up with a steadily increasing number of\n     conflicts. In case this happens,\nCancel\nthe Software\n     Manager,\nAbandon\nall your changes and start again.\nFigure 8.1:\nConflict management of the software manager\n#\n8.3.5\nHandling of package recommendations\n#\nIn addition to the hard dependencies required to run a program (for\n    example a certain library), a package can also have weak dependencies,\n    which add for example extra functionality or translations. These weak\n    dependencies are called package recommendations.\nWhen installing a new package, recommended packages are still\n    installed by default. When updating an existing package, missing\n    recommendations  will not be installed automatically. To change this, set\nPKGMGR_RECOMMENDED=\"yes\"\nin\n/etc/sysconfig/yast2\n. To install all missing\n    recommendations for already installed packages, start\nYaST\n›\nSoftware Manager\nand choose\nExtras\n›\nInstall All Matching Recommended Packages\n.\nTo disable the installation of recommended packages when installing new\n    packages, deactivate\nDependencies\n›\nInstall Recommended Packages\nin the\n    YaST Software Manager. When using the command-line tool Zypper to install\n    packages, use the option\n--no-recommends.\n8.4\nManaging software repositories and services\n#\nTo install third-party software, add software repositories to your\n  system. By default, the product repositories such as\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n-DVD\n15 SP4\nand a matching update repository\n  are automatically configured\nafter you have\n  registered your system. For more information about registration, see\nSection 8.7, “Registration”\nor\nSection 4.8, “Registering your system”\n. Depending on the\n  initially selected product, an additional repository containing\n  translations, dictionaries, etc. might also be configured.\nTo manage repositories, start YaST and select\nSoftware\n›\nSoftware Repositories\n. The\nConfigured Software Repositories\ndialog\n  opens. Here, you can also manage subscriptions to so-called\nServices\nby changing the\nView\nat the\n  right corner of the dialog to\nAll Services\n. A Service in\n  this context is a\nRepository Index Service\n(RIS) that can\n  offer one or more software repositories. Such a Service can be changed\n  dynamically by its administrator or vendor.\nEach repository provides files describing content of the repository (package\n  names, versions, etc.). These repository description files are downloaded to\n  a local cache that is used by YaST. To ensure their integrity, software\n  repositories can be signed with the GPG Key of the repository maintainer.\n  Whenever you add a new repository, YaST offers the ability to import its\n  key.\nWarning: Trusting external software sources\nBefore adding external software repositories to your list of repositories,\n   make sure this repository can be trusted. SUSE is not responsible for any\n   problems arising from software installed from third-party software\n   repositories.\n8.4.1\nAdding software repositories\n#\nYou can either add repositories from DVD/CD, a USB flash drive, a local\n   directory, an ISO image, or a network source.\nTo add repositories from the\nConfigured Software\n   Repositories\ndialog in YaST proceed as follows:\nClick\nAdd\n.\nSelect one of the options listed in the dialog:\nFigure 8.2:\nAdding a software repository\n#\nTo scan your network for installation servers announcing their services\n       via SLP, select\nScan Using SLP\nand click\nNext\n.\nTo add a repository from a removable medium, choose the relevant option\n       and insert the medium or connect the USB device to the machine,\n       respectively. Click\nNext\nto start the installation.\nFor the majority of repositories, you will be asked to specify the path\n       (or URL) to the media after selecting the respective option and clicking\nNext\n. Specifying a\nRepository Name\nis optional. If none is specified, YaST will use the product name or\n       the URL as repository name.\nThe option\nDownload Repository Description Files\nis\n     activated by default. If you deactivate the option, YaST will\n     automatically download the files later, if needed.\nDepending on the repository you have added, you may be prompted to import\n     the repository's GPG key or asked to agree to a\n     license.\nAfter confirming these messages, YaST will download and parse the\n     metadata. It will add the repository to the list of\nConfigured\n     Repositories\n.\nIf needed, adjust the repository\nProperties\nas\n     described in\nSection 8.4.2, “Managing repository properties”\n.\nConfirm your changes with\nOK\nto close the configuration\n     dialog.\nAfter having successfully added the repository, the software manager\n     starts and you can install packages from this repository. For details,\n     refer to\nChapter 8,\nInstalling or removing software\n.\n8.4.2\nManaging repository properties\n#\nThe\nConfigured Software Repositories\noverview of the\nSoftware Repositories\nlets you change the following\n   repository properties:\nStatus\nThe repository status can either be\nEnabled\nor\nDisabled\n. You can only install packages from\n      repositories that are enabled. To turn a repository off temporarily,\n      select it and deactivate\nEnable\n. You can also\n      double-click a repository name to toggle its status. To\n      remove a repository completely, click\nDelete\n.\nRefresh\nWhen refreshing a repository, its content description (package names,\n      versions, etc.) is downloaded to a local cache that is used by YaST. It\n      is sufficient to do this once for static repositories such as CDs or\n      DVDs, whereas repositories whose content changes often should be\n      refreshed frequently. The easiest way to keep a repository's cache\n      up to date is to choose\nAutomatically Refresh\n. To do a\n      manual refresh click\nRefresh\nand select one of the\n      options.\nKeep Downloaded Packages\nPackages from remote repositories are downloaded before being installed.\n      By default, they are deleted upon successful installation. Activating\nKeep Downloaded Packages\nprevents the deletion of\n      downloaded packages. The download location is configured in\n/etc/zypp/zypp.conf\n, by default it is\n/var/cache/zypp/packages\n.\nPriority\nThe\nPriority\nof a repository is a value between\n1\nand\n200\n, with\n1\nbeing the highest priority and\n200\nthe lowest priority. Any new repositories that are\n      added with YaST get a priority of\n99\nby default. If\n      you do not care about a priority value for a certain repository, you can\n      also set the value to\n0\nto apply the default priority\n      to that repository (\n99\n). If a package is available in\n      more than one repository, then the repository with the highest priority\n      takes precedence. This is useful to avoid downloading\n      packages unnecessarily from the Internet by giving a local repository\n      (for example, a DVD) a higher priority.\nImportant: Priority compared to version\nThe repository with the highest priority takes precedence in any case.\n       Therefore, make sure that the update repository always has the highest\n       priority, otherwise you might install an outdated version that will not\n       be updated until the next online update.\nName and URL\nTo change a repository name or its URL, select it from the list with a\n      single-click and then click\nEdit\n.\n8.4.3\nManaging repository keys\n#\nTo ensure their integrity, software repositories can be signed with the\n   GPG Key of the repository maintainer. Whenever you add a new repository,\n   YaST offers to import its key. Verify it as you would do with any other\n   GPG key and make sure it does not change. If you detect a key change,\n   something might be wrong with the repository. Disable the repository as an\n   installation source until you know the cause of the key change.\nTo manage all imported keys, click\nGPG Keys\nin the\nConfigured Software Repositories\ndialog. Select an entry\n   with the mouse to show the key properties at the bottom of the window.\nAdd\n,\nEdit\n, or\nDelete\nkeys with a click on the respective buttons.\n8.5\nThe GNOME package updater\n#\nSUSE offers a continuous stream of software security patches and updates\n  for your product. They can be installed using tools available with your\n  desktop or by running the\nYaST online update\nmodule. This section describes how to update the system from the GNOME\n  desktop using the\nPackage Updater\n.\nContrary to the YaST Online Update module, the GNOME\nPackage\n  Updater\nnot only offers to install patches from the update\n  repositories, but also new versions of packages that are already\n  installed. (Patches fix security issues or malfunctions; the functionality\n  and version number is usually not changed. New versions of a package increase\n  the version number and usually add functionality or introduce major changes.)\nWhenever new patches or package updates are available, GNOME shows a\n  notification in the notification area or on the lock screen.\nFigure 8.3:\nUpdate notification on GNOME desktop\n#\nTo configure the notification settings for the\nPackage\n  Updater\n, start GNOME\nSettings\nand choose\nNotifications\n›\nPackage Updater\n.\nProcedure 8.2:\nInstalling patches and updates with the GNOME package updater\n#\nTo install the patches and updates, click the notification message. This\n    opens the GNOME\nPackage Updater\n. Alternatively, open\n    the updater from\nActivities\nby typing\npackage\n    U\nand choosing\nPackage Updater\n.\nUpdates are sorted into four categories:\nSecurity updates (patches)\nFix severe security hazards and should always be installed.\nRecommended updates (patches)\nFix issues that could compromise your computer. Installing them is\n       strongly recommended.\nOptional updates (patches)\nFix non-security relevant issues or provide enhancements.\nOther updates\nNew versions of packages that are installed.\nAll available updates are preselected for installation. If you do not want\n    to install all updates, deselect unwanted updates first.  It is strongly\n    recommended to always install all security and recommended updates.\nTo get detailed information on an update, click its title and then\nDetails\n. The information will be displayed in a box\n    beneath the package list.\nClick\nInstall Updates\nto start the installation.\nSome updates may require restarting the machine or logging out. Check the\n     message that is displayed after the installation for instructions.\n8.6\nUpdating packages with\nGNOME Software\n#\nIn addition to the GNOME\nPackage Updater\n, GNOME provides\nGNOME Software\nwhich has the following functionality:\nInstall, update, and remove software delivered as an RPM via PackageKit\nInstall, update, and remove software delivered as a Flatpak\nInstall, update, and remove GNOME shell extensions\n    (\nhttps://extensions.gnome.org\n)\nUpdate firmware for hardware devices using\nLinux Vendor\n    Firmware Service\n(LVFS,\nhttps://fwupd.org\n)\nIn addition to this,\nGNOME Software\nprovides screenshots,\n  ratings, and reviews for software.\nFigure 8.4:\nGNOME Software\n—\nUpdates\nview\n#\nGNOME Software\nhas the following differences to other\n  tools provided on\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n:\nUnlike YaST or Zypper, for installing software packaged as an RPM,\nGNOME Software\nis restricted to software that\n    provides AppStream metadata. This includes most desktop applications.\nWhile the GNOME\nPackage Updater\nupdates packages within\n    the running system (forcing you to restart the respective applications),\nGNOME Software\ndownloads the updates but only applies\n    them at the next reboot of the system.\nOn this page\n8.1\nDefinition of terms\n8.2\nRegistering an installed system\n8.3\nUsing the YaST software manager\n8.4\nManaging software repositories and services\n8.5\nThe GNOME package updater\n8.6\nUpdating packages with\nGNOME Software\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

For a definition of the terminology used in this context (for\n    example,\nrepository\n,\npatch\n, or\nupdate\n) refer to\nSection 8.1, “Definition of terms”\n.\n9.1\nUsing Zypper\n#\nZypper is a command line package manager for installing, updating, and\n  removing packages. It also manages repositories. It is especially useful for\n  accomplishing remote software management tasks or managing software from\n  shell scripts.\n9.1.1\nGeneral usage\n#\nThe general syntax of Zypper is:\nzypper\n[--global-options]\nCOMMAND\n[--command-options]\n[arguments]\nThe components enclosed in brackets are not required. See\nzypper\n   help\nfor a list of general options and all commands. To get help\n   for a specific command, type\nzypper help\nCOMMAND\n.\nZypper commands\nThe simplest way to execute Zypper is to type its name, followed by a\n      command. For example, to apply all needed patches to the system, use:\n>\nsudo\nzypper patch\nGlobal options\nAdditionally, you can choose from one or more global options by typing\n      them immediately before the command:\n>\nsudo\nzypper --non-interactive patch\nIn the above example, the option\n--non-interactive\nmeans\n      that the command is run without asking anything (automatically applying\n      the default answers).\nCommand-specific options\nTo use options that are specific to a particular command, type them\n      immediately after the command:\n>\nsudo\nzypper patch --auto-agree-with-licenses\nIn the above example,\n--auto-agree-with-licenses\nis used\n      to apply all needed patches to a system without you being asked to\n      confirm any licenses. Instead, licenses will be accepted automatically.\nArguments\nSome commands require one or more arguments. For example, when using the\n      command\ninstall\n, you need to specify which package or\n      which packages you want to\ninstall\n:\n>\nsudo\nzypper install mplayer\nSome options also require a single argument. The following command will\n      list all known patterns:\n>\nzypper search -t pattern\nYou can combine all of the above. For example, the following command will\n   install the\nmc\nand\nvim\npackages from\n   the\nfactory\nrepository while being verbose:\n>\nsudo\nzypper -v install --from factory mc vim\nThe\n--from\noption keeps all repositories\n   enabled (for solving any dependencies) while requesting the package from the\n   specified repository.\n--repo\nis an alias for\n--from\n, and you may use either one.\nMost Zypper commands have a\ndry-run\noption that does a\n   simulation of the given command. It can be used for test purposes.\n>\nsudo\nzypper remove --dry-run MozillaFirefox\nZypper supports the global\n--userdata\nSTRING\noption. You can specify a string\n   with this option, which gets written to Zypper's log files and plug-ins\n   (such as the Btrfs plug-in). It can be used to mark and identify\n   transactions in log files.\n>\nsudo\nzypper --userdata\nSTRING\npatch\n9.1.2\nUsing Zypper subcommands\n#\nZypper subcommands are executables that are stored in the directory\n   specified by the\nzypper_execdir\nconfiguration option. It is\n/usr/lib/zypper/commands\nby default. If a subcommand\n   is not found there, Zypper automatically searches the rest of your $PATH\n   locations for it. This lets you create your own local extensions and store\n   them in user space.\nExecuting subcommands in the Zypper shell, and using global Zypper options\n   are not supported.\nList your available subcommands:\n>\nzypper help subcommand\n[...]\nAvailable zypper subcommands in '/usr/lib/zypper/commands'\n\n  appstream-cache\n  lifecycle\n  migration\n  search-packages\n\nZypper subcommands available from elsewhere on your $PATH\n\n  log                   Zypper logfile reader\n                            (/usr/sbin/zypper-log)\nView the help screen for a subcommand:\n>\nzypper help appstream-cache\n9.1.3\nInstalling and removing software with Zypper\n#\nTo install or remove packages, use the following commands:\n>\nsudo\nzypper install\nPACKAGE_NAME\n>\nsudo\nzypper remove\nPACKAGE_NAME\nWarning: Do not remove mandatory system packages\nDo not remove mandatory system packages like\nglibc\n,\nzypper\n,\nkernel\n. If they are\n    removed, the system can become unstable or stop working altogether.\n9.1.3.1\nSelecting which packages to install or remove\n#\nThere are various ways to address packages with the commands\nzypper install\nand\nzypper remove\n.\nBy exact package name\n>\nsudo\nzypper install MozillaFirefox\nBy exact package name and version number\n>\nsudo\nzypper install MozillaFirefox-52.2\nBy repository alias and package name\n>\nsudo\nzypper install mozilla:MozillaFirefox\nWhere\nmozilla\nis the alias of the repository from\n       which to install.\nBy package name using wild cards\nYou can select all packages that have names starting or ending with a\n       certain string. Use wild cards with care, especially when removing\n       packages. The following command will install all packages starting with\n“\nMoz\n”\n:\n>\nsudo\nzypper install 'Moz*'\nTip: Removing all\n-debuginfo\npackages\nWhen debugging a problem, you sometimes need to temporarily install a\n        lot of\n-debuginfo\npackages which give you more\n        information about running processes. After your debugging session\n        finishes and you need to clean the environment, run the following:\n>\nsudo\nzypper remove '*-debuginfo'\nBy capability\nFor example, to install a package without knowing its name, capabilities\n       come in handy. The following command will install the package\nMozillaFirefox\n:\n>\nsudo\nzypper install firefox\nBy capability, hardware architecture, or version\nTogether with a capability, you can specify a hardware architecture and\n       a version:\nThe name of the desired hardware architecture is appended to the\n         capability after a full stop. For example, to specify the AMD64/Intel 64\n         architectures (which in Zypper is named\nx86_64\n),\n         use:\n>\nsudo\nzypper install 'firefox.x86_64'\nVersions must be appended to the end of the string and must be\n         preceded by an operator:\n<\n(lesser than),\n<=\n(lesser than or equal),\n=\n(equal),\n>=\n(greater than or equal),\n>\n(greater than).\n>\nsudo\nzypper install 'firefox>=74.2'\nYou can also combine a hardware architecture and version requirement:\n>\nsudo\nzypper install 'firefox.x86_64>=74.2'\nBy path to the RPM file\nYou can also specify a local or remote path to a package:\n>\nsudo\nzypper install /tmp/install/MozillaFirefox.rpm\n>\nsudo\nzypper install http://download.example.com/MozillaFirefox.rpm\n9.1.3.2\nCombining installation and removal of packages\n#\nTo install and remove packages simultaneously, use the\n+/-\nmodifiers. To install\nemacs\nand\n    simultaneously remove\nvim\n, use:\n>\nsudo\nzypper install emacs -vim\nTo remove\nemacs\nand simultaneously install\nvim\n, use:\n>\nsudo\nzypper remove emacs +vim\nTo prevent the package name starting with the\n-\nbeing\n    interpreted as a command option, always use it as the second argument. If\n    this is not possible, precede it with\n--\n:\n>\nsudo\nzypper install -emacs +vim       # Wrong\n>\nsudo\nzypper install vim -emacs        # Correct\n>\nsudo\nzypper install -- -emacs +vim    # Correct\n>\nsudo\nzypper remove emacs +vim         # Correct\n9.1.3.3\nCleaning up dependencies of removed packages\n#\nIf (together with a certain package), you automatically want to remove any\n    packages that become unneeded after removing the specified package, use the\n--clean-deps\noption:\n>\nsudo\nzypper rm --clean-deps\nPACKAGE_NAME\n9.1.3.4\nUsing Zypper in scripts\n#\nBy default, Zypper asks for a confirmation before installing or removing a\n    selected package, or when a problem occurs. You can override this behavior\n    using the\n--non-interactive\noption. This option must be\n    given before the actual command (\ninstall\n,\nremove\n, and\npatch\n), as can be seen in\n    the following:\n>\nsudo\nzypper\n--non-interactive\ninstall\nPACKAGE_NAME\nThis option allows the use of Zypper in scripts and cron jobs.\n9.1.3.5\nInstalling or downloading source packages\n#\nTo install the corresponding source package of a package, use:\n>\nzypper source-install\nPACKAGE_NAME\nWhen executed as\nroot\n, the default location to install source\n    packages is\n/usr/src/packages/\nand\n~/rpmbuild\nwhen run as user. These values can be\n    changed in your local\nrpm\nconfiguration.\nThis command will also install the build dependencies of the specified\n    package. If you do not want this, add the switch\n-D\n:\n>\nsudo\nzypper source-install -D\nPACKAGE_NAME\nTo install only the build dependencies use\n-d\n.\n>\nsudo\nzypper source-install -d\nPACKAGE_NAME\nOf course, this will only work if you have the repository with the source\n    packages enabled in your repository list (it is added by default, but not\n    enabled). See\nSection 9.1.6, “Managing repositories with Zypper”\nfor details on\n    repository management.\nA list of all source packages available in your repositories can be\n    obtained with:\n>\nzypper search -t srcpackage\nYou can also download source packages for all installed packages to a local\n    directory. To download source packages, use:\n>\nzypper source-download\nThe default download directory is\n/var/cache/zypper/source-download\n. You can change it\n    using the\n--directory\noption. To only show missing or\n    extraneous packages without downloading or deleting anything, use the\n--status\noption. To delete extraneous source packages, use\n    the\n--delete\noption. To disable deleting, use the\n--no-delete\noption.\n9.1.3.6\nInstalling packages from disabled repositories\n#\nNormally you can only install or refresh packages from enabled\n    repositories. The\n--plus-content\nTAG\noption helps you specify\n    repositories to be refreshed, temporarily enabled during the current Zypper\n    session, and disabled after it completes.\nFor example, to enable repositories that may provide additional\n-debuginfo\nor\n-debugsource\npackages, use\n--plus-content debug\n. You can specify this\n    option multiple times.\nTo temporarily enable such 'debug' repositories to install a specific\n-debuginfo\npackage, use the option as follows:\n>\nsudo\nzypper --plus-content debug \\\n   install \"debuginfo(build-id)=eb844a5c20c70a59fc693cd1061f851fb7d046f4\"\nThe\nbuild-id\nstring is reported by\ngdb\nfor missing debuginfo packages.\nNote: Disabled installation media\nRepositories from the\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\ninstallation media are still\n     configured but disabled after successful installation. You can use the\n--plus-content\noption to install packages from the\n     installation media instead of the online repositories. Before calling\nzypper\n, ensure the media is available, for example by\n     inserting the DVD into the computer's drive.\n9.1.3.7\nUtilities\n#\nTo verify whether all dependencies are still fulfilled and to repair\n    missing dependencies, use:\n>\nzypper verify\nIn addition to dependencies that must be fulfilled, some packages\n“\nrecommend\n”\nother packages. These recommended packages are\n    only installed if actually available and installable. In case recommended\n    packages were made available after the recommending package has been\n    installed (by adding additional packages or hardware), use the following\n    command:\n>\nsudo\nzypper install-new-recommends\nThis command is very useful after plugging in a Web cam or Wi-Fi device. It\n    will install drivers for the device and related software, if available.\n    Drivers and related software are only installable if certain hardware\n    dependencies are fulfilled.\n9.1.4\nUpdating software with Zypper\n#\nThere are three different ways to update software using Zypper: by\n   installing patches, by installing a new version of a package or by updating\n   the entire distribution. The latter is achieved with\nzypper\n   dist-upgrade\n. Upgrading\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nis discussed in\nChapter 1,\nUpgrade paths and methods\n.\n9.1.4.1\nInstalling all needed patches\n#\nPatching\nSUSE Linux Enterprise is the most reliable way to install\n    new versions of installed packages. It guarantees that all required\n    packages with correct versions are installed and ensures that package versions\n    considered as\nconflicting\nare omitted.\nTo install all officially released patches that apply to your system, run:\n>\nsudo\nzypper patch\nAll patches available from repositories configured on your computer are\n    checked for their relevance to your installation. If they are relevant (and\n    not classified as\noptional\nor\nfeature\n), they are installed immediately.\n    If\nzypper patch\nsucceeds, it is guaranteed that no\n    vulnerable version package is installed unless you confirm the exception.\nNote that the official update repository is only\n    available after registering your\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\ninstallation.\nIf a patch that is about to be installed includes changes that require a\n    system reboot, you will be warned before.\nThe plain\nzypper patch\ncommand does not apply patches\n    from third party repositories. To update also the third party repositories,\n    use the\nwith-update\ncommand option as follows:\n>\nsudo\nzypper patch --with-update\nTo install also optional patches, use:\n>\nsudo\nzypper patch --with-optional\nTo install all patches relating to a specific Bugzilla issue, use:\n>\nsudo\nzypper patch --bugzilla=\nNUMBER\nTo install all patches relating to a specific CVE database entry, use:\n>\nsudo\nzypper patch --cve=\nNUMBER\nFor example, to install a security patch with the CVE number\nCVE-2010-2713\n, execute:\n>\nsudo\nzypper patch --cve=CVE-2010-2713\nTo install only patches which affect Zypper and the package management\n    itself, use:\n>\nsudo\nzypper patch --updatestack-only\nBear in mind that other command options that would also update other\n    repositories will be dropped if you use the\nupdatestack-only\ncommand option.\n9.1.4.2\nListing patches\n#\nTo find out whether patches are available, Zypper allows viewing the\n    following information:\nNumber of needed patches\nTo list the number of needed patches (patches that apply to your system\n       but are not yet installed), use\npatch-check\n:\n>\nzypper patch-check\nLoading repository data...\nReading installed packages...\n5 patches needed (1 security patch)\nThis command can be combined with the\n--updatestack-only\noption to list only the patches\n       which affect Zypper and the package management itself.\nList of needed patches\nTo list all needed patches (patches that apply to your system but are\n       not yet installed), use\nzypper list-patches\n.\nList of all patches\nTo list all patches available for\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n, regardless of whether\n       they are already installed or apply to your installation, use\nzypper patches\n.\nIt is also possible to list and install patches relevant to specific\n    issues. To list specific patches, use the\nzypper\n    list-patches\ncommand with the following options:\nBy Bugzilla issues\nTo list all needed patches that relate to Bugzilla issues, use the\n       option\n--bugzilla\n.\nTo list patches for a specific bug, you can also specify a bug number:\n--bugzilla=\nNUMBER\n. To search\n       for patches relating to multiple Bugzilla issues, add commas between the\n       bug numbers, for example:\n>\nzypper list-patches --bugzilla=972197,956917\nBy CVE number\nTo list all needed patches that relate to an entry in the CVE database\n       (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures), use the option\n--cve\n.\nTo list patches for a specific CVE database entry, you can also specify\n       a CVE number:\n--cve=\nNUMBER\n.\n       To search for patches relating to multiple CVE database entries, add\n       commas between the CVE numbers, for example:\n>\nzypper list-patches --cve=CVE-2016-2315,CVE-2016-2324\nList retracted patches\nIn the SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 codestream, some patches are automatically \n          retracted. Maintenance updates are carefully tested, because there \n          is a risk that an update contains a new bug. If an update proves to\n          contain a bug, a new update (with a higher version number) is \n          issued to revert the buggy update, and the buggy update is blocked \n          from being installed again. You can list retracted patches with\nzypper\n:\n>\nzypper lp --all |grep retracted\nSLE-Module-Basesystem15-SP3-Updates | SUSE-SLE-Module-Basesystem-15-SP3-2021-1965 \n | recommended | important | ---    | retracted  | Recommended update for multipath-tools \nSLE-Module-Basesystem15-SP3-Updates | SUSE-SLE-Module-Basesystem-15-SP3-2021-2689 \n | security    | important | ---    | retracted  | Security update for cpio\nSLE-Module-Basesystem15-SP3-Updates | SUSE-SLE-Module-Basesystem-15-SP3-2021-3655 \n | security    | important | reboot | retracted  | Security update for the Linux Kernel\nSee complete information on a retracted (or any) patch:\n>\nzypper patch-info SUSE-SLE-Product-SLES-15-2021-2689\nLoading repository data...\nReading installed packages...\n\nInformation for patch SUSE-SLE-Product-SLES-15-2021-2689:\n---------------------------------------------------------\nRepository  : SLE-Product-SLES15-LTSS-Updates\nName        : SUSE-SLE-Product-SLES-15-2021-2689\nVersion     : 1\nArch        : noarch\nVendor      : maint-coord@suse.de\nStatus      : retracted\nCategory    : security\nSeverity    : important\nCreated On  : Mon 16 Aug 2021 03:44:00 AM PDT\nInteractive : ---\nSummary     : Security update for cpio\nDescription : \n    This update for cpio fixes the following issues:\n\n    It was possible to trigger Remote code execution due to a integer overflow \n    (CVE-2021-38185, bsc#1189206)\n\n    UPDATE:\n    This update was buggy and could lead to hangs, so it has been retracted. \n    There will be a follow up update.\n    [...]\nPatch with conflicting packages\nInformation for patch openSUSE-SLE-15.3-2022-333:\n-------------------------------------------------\nRepository  : Update repository with updates from SUSE Linux Enterprise 15\nName        : openSUSE-SLE-15.3-2022-333\nVersion     : 1\nArch        : noarch\nVendor      : maint-coord@suse.de\nStatus      : needed\nCategory    : security\nSeverity    : important\nCreated On  : Fri Feb  4 09:30:32 2022\nInteractive : reboot\nSummary     : Security update for xen\nDescription :\n    This update for xen fixes the following issues:\n\n    - CVE-2022-23033: Fixed guest_physmap_remove_page not removing the p2m mappings.

If any of these affected or vulnerable packages are\n         installed, it triggers a conflict, and the patch is classified as\nneeded\n.\nzypper patch\ntries to\n         install all available patches. If it encounters problems, it reports\n         them, thus informing you that not all updates are installed. The\n         conflict can be resolved by either updating the affected or vulnerable\n         packages or by removing them. Because SUSE update repositories also\n         ship fixed packages, updating is a standard way to resolve conflicts.\n         If the package cannot be updated—for example, because of dependency\n         issues or package locks—it is deleted after the user's approval.\nTo list all patches regardless of whether they are needed, use the option\n--all\nadditionally. For example, to list all patches with\n    a CVE number assigned, use:\n>\nzypper list-patches --all --cve\nIssue | No.           | Patch             | Category    | Severity  | Status\n------+---------------+-------------------+-------------+-----------+----------\ncve   | CVE-2019-0287 | SUSE-SLE-Module.. | recommended | moderate  | needed\ncve   | CVE-2019-3566 | SUSE-SLE-SERVER.. | recommended | moderate  | not needed\n[...]\n9.1.4.3\nInstalling new package versions\n#\nIf a repository contains only new packages, but does not provide patches,\nzypper patch\ndoes not show any effect. To update\n    all installed packages with newer available versions, use the following command:\n>\nsudo\nzypper update\nImportant\nzypper update\nignores problematic packages.\n  For example, if a package is locked,\nzypper update\nomits the package, even if a higher version of it is available. Conversely,\nzypper patch\nreports a conflict if the package is\n  considered vulnerable.\nTo update individual packages, specify the package with either the update\n    or install command:\n>\nsudo\nzypper update\nPACKAGE_NAME\n>\nsudo\nzypper install\nPACKAGE_NAME\nA list of all new installable packages can be obtained with the command:\n>\nzypper list-updates\nNote that this command only lists packages that match the following\n    criteria:\nhas the same vendor like the already installed package,\nis provided by repositories with at least the same priority than the\n      already installed package,\nis installable (all dependencies are satisfied).\nA list of\nall\nnew available packages (regardless\n    whether installable or not) can be obtained with:\n>\nsudo\nzypper list-updates --all\nTo find out why a new package cannot be installed, use the\nzypper\n    install\nor\nzypper update\ncommand as described\n    above.\n9.1.4.4\nIdentifying orphaned packages\n#\nWhenever you remove a repository from Zypper or upgrade your system, some\n    packages can get in an\n“\norphaned\n”\nstate. These\norphaned\npackages belong to no active repository\n    anymore. The following command gives you a list of these:\n>\nsudo\nzypper packages --orphaned\nWith this list, you can decide if a package is still needed or can be\n    removed safely.\n9.1.5\nIdentifying processes and services using deleted files\n#\nWhen patching, updating, or removing packages, there may be running processes\n   on the system which continue to use files having been deleted by the update\n   or removal. Use\nzypper ps\nto list processes using deleted\n   files. In case the process belongs to a known service, the service name is\n   listed, making it easy to restart the service. By default\nzypper\n   ps\nshows a table:\n>\nzypper ps\nPID   | PPID | UID | User  | Command      | Service      | Files\n------+------+-----+-------+--------------+--------------+-------------------\n814   | 1    | 481 | avahi | avahi-daemon | avahi-daemon | /lib64/ld-2.19.s->\n      |      |     |       |              |              | /lib64/libdl-2.1->\n      |      |     |       |              |              | /lib64/libpthrea->\n      |      |     |       |              |              | /lib64/libc-2.19->\n[...]\nPID\n: ID of the process\nPPID\n: ID of the parent process\nUID\n: ID of the user running the\n    process\nLogin\n: Login name of the user\n    running the process\nCommand\n: Command used to\n    execute the process\nService\n: Service name (only if command\n    is associated with a system service)\nFiles\n: The list of the deleted\n    files\nThe output format of\nzypper ps\ncan be controlled as\n   follows:\nzypper ps\n-s\nCreate a short table not showing the deleted files.\n>\nzypper ps -s\nPID   | PPID | UID  | User    | Command      | Service\n------+------+------+---------+--------------+--------------\n814   | 1    | 481  | avahi   | avahi-daemon | avahi-daemon\n817   | 1    | 0    | root    | irqbalance   | irqbalance\n1567  | 1    | 0    | root    | sshd         | sshd\n1761  | 1    | 0    | root    | master       | postfix\n1764  | 1761 | 51   | postfix | pickup       | postfix\n1765  | 1761 | 51   | postfix | qmgr         | postfix\n2031  | 2027 | 1000 | tux     | bash         |\nzypper ps\n-ss\nShow only processes associated with a system service.\nPID   | PPID | UID  | User    | Command      | Service\n------+------+------+---------+--------------+--------------\n814   | 1    | 481  | avahi   | avahi-daemon | avahi-daemon\n817   | 1    | 0    | root    | irqbalance   | irqbalance\n1567  | 1    | 0    | root    | sshd         | sshd\n1761  | 1    | 0    | root    | master       | postfix\n1764  | 1761 | 51   | postfix | pickup       | postfix\n1765  | 1761 | 51   | postfix | qmgr         | postfix\nzypper ps\n-sss\nOnly show system services using deleted files.\navahi-daemon\nirqbalance\npostfix\nsshd\nzypper ps\n--print \"systemctl status %s\"\nShow the commands to retrieve status information for services which might\n      need a restart.\nsystemctl status avahi-daemon\nsystemctl status irqbalance\nsystemctl status postfix\nsystemctl status sshd\nFor more information about service handling refer to\nChapter 19,\nThe\nsystemd\ndaemon\n.\n9.1.6\nManaging repositories with Zypper\n#\nAll installation or patch commands of Zypper rely on a list of known\n   repositories. To list all repositories known to the system, use the command:\n>\nzypper repos\nThe result will look similar to the following output:\nExample 9.1:\nZypper—list of known repositories\n#\n>\nzypper repos\n# | Alias        | Name          | Enabled | Refresh\n--+--------------+---------------+---------+--------\n1 | SLEHA-15-GEO | SLEHA-15-GEO  | Yes     | No\n2 | SLEHA-15     | SLEHA-15      | Yes     | No\n3 | SLES15       | SLES15        | Yes     | No\nWhen specifying repositories in various commands, an alias, URI or\n   repository number from the\nzypper repos\ncommand output\n   can be used. A repository alias is a short version of the repository name\n   for use in repository handling commands. Note that the repository numbers\n   can change after modifying the list of repositories. The alias will never\n   change by itself.\nBy default, details such as the URI or the priority of the repository are\n   not displayed. Use the following command to list all details:\n>\nzypper repos -d\n9.1.6.1\nAdding repositories\n#\nTo add a repository, run\n>\nsudo\nzypper addrepo\nURI\nALIAS\nURI\ncan either be an Internet repository, a\n    network resource, a directory or a CD or DVD (see\nhttps://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Libzypp_URIs\nfor\n    details). The\nALIAS\nis a shorthand and unique\n    identifier of the repository. You can freely choose it, with the only\n    exception that it needs to be unique. Zypper will issue a warning if you\n    specify an alias that is already in use.\n9.1.6.2\nRefreshing repositories\n#\nzypper\nenables you to fetch changes in packages from\n    configured repositories. To fetch the changes, run:\n>\nsudo\nzypper refresh\nNote: Default behavior of\nzypper\nBy default, some commands perform\nrefresh\nautomatically, so you do not need to run the command explicitly.\nThe\nrefresh\ncommand enables you to view changes also in\n    disabled repositories, by using the\n--plus-content\noption:\n>\nsudo\nzypper --plus-content refresh\nThis option fetches changes in repositories, but keeps the disabled\n    repositories in the same state—disabled.\n9.1.6.3\nRemoving repositories\n#\nTo remove a repository from the list, use the command\nzypper\n    removerepo\ntogether with the alias or number of the repository\n    you want to delete. For example, to remove the repository\nSLEHA-12-GEO\nfrom\nExample 9.1, “Zypper—list of known repositories”\n, use one of the following commands:\n>\nsudo\nzypper removerepo 1\n>\nsudo\nzypper removerepo \"SLEHA-12-GEO\"\n9.1.6.4\nModifying repositories\n#\nEnable or disable repositories with\nzypper modifyrepo\n.\n    You can also alter the repository's properties (such as refreshing\n    behavior, name or priority) with this command. The following command will\n    enable the repository named\nupdates\n, turn on\n    auto-refresh and set its priority to 20:\n>\nsudo\nzypper modifyrepo -er -p 20 'updates'\nModifying repositories is not limited to a single repository—you can\n    also operate on groups:\n-a\n: all repositories\n-l\n: local repositories\n-t\n: remote repositories\n-m\nTYPE\n: repositories\n     of a certain type (where\nTYPE\ncan be one of the\n     following:\nhttp\n,\nhttps\n,\nftp\n,\ncd\n,\ndvd\n,\ndir\n,\nfile\n,\ncifs\n,\nsmb\n,\nnfs\n,\nhd\n,\niso\n)\nTo rename a repository alias, use the\nrenamerepo\ncommand. The following example changes the alias from\nMozilla\n    Firefox\nto\nfirefox\n:\n>\nsudo\nzypper renamerepo 'Mozilla Firefox' firefox\n9.1.7\nQuerying repositories and packages with Zypper\n#\nZypper offers various methods to query repositories or packages. To get\n   lists of all products, patterns, packages or patches available, use the\n   following commands:\n>\nzypper products\n>\nzypper patterns\n>\nzypper packages\n>\nzypper patches\nTo query all repositories for certain packages, use\nsearch\n. To get information regarding particular packages,\n   use the\ninfo\ncommand.\n9.1.7.1\nSearching for software\n#\nThe\nzypper search\ncommand works on package names, or,\n    optionally, on package summaries and descriptions. Strings wrapped in\n/\nare interpreted as regular expressions. By default,\n    the search is not case-sensitive.\nSimple search for a package name containing\nfire\n>\nzypper search \"fire\"\nSimple search for the exact package\nMozillaFirefox\n>\nzypper search --match-exact \"MozillaFirefox\"\nAlso search in package descriptions and summaries\n>\nzypper search -d fire\nOnly display packages not already installed\n>\nzypper search -u fire\nDisplay packages containing the string\nfir\nnot followed be\ne\n>\nzypper se \"/fir[^e]/\"\n9.1.7.2\nSearching for packages across all SLE modules\n#\nTo search for packages both within and outside of currently enabled SLE\n    modules, use the\nsearch-packages\nsubcommand. This\n    command contacts the SUSE Customer Center and searches all modules for matching packages,\n    for example:\n>\nzypper search-packages\npackage1\npackage2\nzypper search-packages\nprovides the following options:\nSearch for an exact match of your search string:\n-x\n,\n--match-exact\nGroup the results by module (default: group by package):\n-g,\n--group-by-module\nDisplay more detailed information about packages:\n-d\n,\n--details\nOutput search results in XML:\n--xmlout\n9.1.7.3\nSearching for specific capability\n#\nTo search for packages which provide a special capability, use the command\nwhat-provides\n. For example, if you want to know which\n    package provides the Perl module\nSVN::Core\n, use the\n    following command:\n>\nzypper what-provides 'perl(SVN::Core)'\nThe\nwhat-provides\nPACKAGE_NAME\nis similar to\nrpm -q --whatprovides\nPACKAGE_NAME\n, but RPM is only able to query the\n    RPM database (that is the database of all installed packages). Zypper, on\n    the other hand, will tell you about providers of the capability from any\n    repository, not only those that are installed.\n9.1.7.4\nShowing package information\n#\nTo query single packages, use\ninfo\nwith an exact package\n    name as an argument. This displays detailed information about a package. In\n    case the package name does not match any package name from repositories,\n    the command outputs detailed information for non-package matches. If you\n    request a specific type (by using the\n-t\noption) and the\n    type does not exist, the command outputs other available matches but\n    without detailed information.\nIf you specify a source package, the command displays binary packages built\n    from the source package. If you specify a binary package, the command\n    outputs the source packages used to build the binary package.\nTo also show what is required/recommended by the package, use the options\n--requires\nand\n--recommends\n:\n>\nzypper info --requires MozillaFirefox\n9.1.8\nShowing lifecycle information\n#\nSUSE products are generally supported for 10 years. Often, you can extend\n   that standard lifecycle by using the extended support offerings of SUSE\n   which add three years of support. Depending on your product, find the exact\n   support lifecycle at\nhttps://www.suse.com/lifecycle\n.\nTo check the lifecycle of your product and the supported package, use the\nzypper lifecycle\ncommand as shown below:\n#\nzypper lifecycle\nProduct end of support\nCodestream: SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15             2028-07-31\n    Product: SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP3        n/a*\n\nModule end of support\nBasesystem Module                                       n/a*\nDesktop Applications Module                             n/a*\nServer Applications Module                              n/a*\n\nPackage end of support if different from product:\nautofs                                   Now, installed 5.1.3-7.3.1, update available 5.1.3-7.6.1\n9.1.9\nConfiguring Zypper\n#\nZypper now comes with a configuration file, allowing you to permanently\n   change Zypper's behavior (either system-wide or user-specific). For\n   system-wide changes, edit\n/etc/zypp/zypper.conf\n. For\n   user-specific changes, edit\n~/.zypper.conf\n. If\n~/.zypper.conf\ndoes not yet exist, you can use\n/etc/zypp/zypper.conf\nas a template: copy it to\n~/.zypper.conf\nand adjust it to your liking. Refer to\n   the comments in the file for help about the available options.\n9.1.10\nTroubleshooting\n#\nIf you have trouble accessing packages from configured repositories (for\n   example, Zypper cannot find a certain package even though you know it exists\n   in one of the repositories), refreshing the repositories may help:\n>\nsudo\nzypper refresh\nIf that does not help, try\n>\nsudo\nzypper refresh -fdb\nThis forces a complete refresh and rebuild of the database, including a\n   forced download of raw metadata.\n9.1.11\nZypper rollback feature on Btrfs file system\n#\nIf the Btrfs file system is used on the root partition and\nsnapper\nis installed, Zypper automatically calls\nsnapper\nwhen committing changes to the file system to\n   create appropriate file system snapshots. These snapshots can be used to\n   revert any changes made by Zypper. See\nChapter 10,\nSystem recovery and snapshot management with Snapper\nfor\n   more information.\n9.1.12\nMore information\n#\nFor more information on managing software from the command line, enter\nzypper help\n,\nzypper help\nCOMMAND\nor refer to the\nzypper(8)\nman page. For a complete and detailed command\n   reference,\ncheat sheets\nwith the most important commands,\n   and information on how to use Zypper in scripts and applications, refer to\nhttps://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Zypper_usage\n. A list of\n   software changes for the latest\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nversion can be found at\nhttps://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Zypper_versions\n.\n9.2\nRPM—the package manager\n#\nRPM (RPM Package Manager) is used for managing software packages. Its main\n  commands are\nrpm\nand\nrpmbuild\n. The\n  powerful RPM database can be queried by the users, system administrators and\n  package builders for detailed information about the installed software.\nrpm\nhas five modes: installing, uninstalling\n  (or updating) software packages, rebuilding the RPM database, querying RPM\n  bases or individual RPM archives, integrity checking of packages and signing\n  packages.\nrpmbuild\ncan be used to build installable\n  packages from pristine sources.\nInstallable RPM archives are packed in a special binary format. These\n  archives consist of the program files to install and certain meta information\n  used during the installation by\nrpm\nto configure the\n  software package or stored in the RPM database for documentation purposes.\n  RPM archives normally have the extension\n.rpm\n.\nTip: Software development packages\nFor several packages, the components needed for software development\n   (libraries, headers, include files, etc.) have been put into separate\n   packages. These development packages are only needed if you want to compile\n   software yourself (for example, the most recent GNOME packages). They can\n   be identified by the name extension\n-devel\n, such as the\n   packages\nalsa-devel\nand\ngimp-devel\n.\n9.2.1\nVerifying package authenticity\n#\nRPM packages have a GPG signature. To verify the signature of an RPM\n   package, use the command\nrpm --checksig\nPACKAGE\n-1.2.3.rpm to determine whether the\n   package originates from SUSE or from another trustworthy facility. This is\n   especially recommended for update packages from the Internet.\nWhile fixing issues in the operating system, you might need to install a\n   Problem Temporary Fix (PTF) into a production system. The packages provided\n   by SUSE are signed against a special PTF key. However, in contrast to\n   SUSE Linux Enterprise 11, this key is not imported by default on SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 systems. To\n   manually import the key, use the following command:\n>\nsudo\nrpm --import \\\n/usr/share/doc/packages/suse-build-key/suse_ptf_key.asc\nAfter importing the key, you can install PTF packages on your system.\n9.2.2\nManaging packages: install, update, and uninstall\n#\nNormally, the installation of an RPM archive is quite simple:\nrpm\n   -i\nPACKAGE\n.rpm. With this command the\n   package is installed, but only if its dependencies are fulfilled and if\n   there are no conflicts with other packages. With an error message,\nrpm\nrequests those packages that need to be installed to\n   meet dependency requirements. In the background, the RPM database ensures\n   that no conflicts arise—a specific file can only belong to one\n   package. By choosing different options, you can force\nrpm\nto ignore these defaults, but this is only for experts. Otherwise, you risk\n   compromising the integrity of the system and possibly jeopardize the ability\n   to update the system.\nThe options\n-U\nor\n--upgrade\nand\n-F\nor\n--freshen\ncan be used to update a\n   package (for example,\nrpm -F\nPACKAGE\n.rpm). This command removes the files of\n   the old version and immediately installs the new files. The difference\n   between the two versions is that\n-U\ninstalls packages that\n   previously did not exist in the system, while\n-F\nmerely\n   updates previously installed packages. When updating,\nrpm\nupdates configuration files carefully using the following strategy:\nIf a configuration file was not changed by the system administrator,\nrpm\ninstalls the new version of the appropriate file.\n     No action by the system administrator is required.\nIf a configuration file was changed by the system administrator before the\n     update,\nrpm\nsaves the changed file with the extension\n.rpmorig\nor\n.rpmsave\n(backup\n     file) and installs the version from the new package. This is done only if\n     the originally installed file and the newer version are different. If this is\n     the case, compare the backup file (\n.rpmorig\nor\n.rpmsave\n) with the newly installed file and make your\n     changes again in the new file. Afterward, delete all\n.rpmorig\nand\n.rpmsave\nfiles to\n     avoid problems with future updates.\n.rpmnew\nfiles appear if the configuration file\n     already exists\nand\nif the\nnoreplace\nlabel was specified in the\n.spec\nfile.\nFollowing an update,\n.rpmsave\nand\n.rpmnew\nfiles should be removed after comparing them,\n   so they do not obstruct future updates. The\n.rpmorig\nextension is assigned if the file has not previously been recognized by the\n   RPM database.\nOtherwise,\n.rpmsave\nis used. In other words,\n.rpmorig\nresults from updating from a foreign format to\n   RPM.\n.rpmsave\nresults from updating from an older RPM\n   to a newer RPM.\n.rpmnew\ndoes not disclose any\n   information to whether the system administrator has made any changes to the\n   configuration file. A list of these files is available in\n/var/adm/rpmconfigcheck\n. Some configuration files (like\n/etc/httpd/httpd.conf\n) are not overwritten to allow\n   continued operation.\nThe\n-U\nswitch is\nnot\nonly an\n   equivalent to uninstalling with the\n-e\noption and\n   installing with the\n-i\noption. Use\n-U\nwhenever possible.\nTo remove a package, enter\nrpm -e\nPACKAGE\n. This command only deletes the package if\n   there are no unresolved dependencies. It is theoretically impossible to\n   delete Tcl/Tk, for example, as long as another application requires it. Even\n   in this case, RPM calls for assistance from the database. If such a deletion\n   is, for whatever reason, impossible (even if\nno\nadditional dependencies exist), it may be helpful to rebuild the RPM\n   database using the option\n--rebuilddb\n.\n9.2.3\nDelta RPM packages\n#\nDelta RPM packages contain the difference between an old and a new version\n   of an RPM package. Applying a delta RPM onto an old RPM results in a\n   completely new RPM. It is not necessary to have a copy of the old RPM\n   because a delta RPM can also work with an installed RPM. The delta RPM\n   packages are even smaller in size than patch RPMs, which is an advantage\n   when transferring update packages over the Internet. The drawback is that\n   update operations with delta RPMs involved consume considerably more CPU\n   cycles than plain or patch RPMs.\nThe\nmakedeltarpm\nand\napplydelta\nbinaries are part of the delta RPM suite (package\ndeltarpm\n) and help you create and apply delta RPM\n   packages. With the following commands, you can create a delta RPM called\nnew.delta.rpm\n. The following command assumes that\nold.rpm\nand\nnew.rpm\nare present:\n>\nsudo\nmakedeltarpm old.rpm new.rpm new.delta.rpm\nUsing\napplydeltarpm\n, you can reconstruct the new RPM from\n   the file system if the old package is already installed:\n>\nsudo\napplydeltarpm new.delta.rpm new.rpm\nTo derive it from the old RPM without accessing the file system, use the\n-r\noption:\n>\nsudo\napplydeltarpm -r old.rpm new.delta.rpm new.rpm\nSee\n/usr/share/doc/packages/deltarpm/README\nfor\n   technical details.\n9.2.4\nRPM queries\n#\nWith the\n-q\noption\nrpm\ninitiates\n   queries, making it possible to inspect an RPM archive (by adding the option\n-p\n) and to query the RPM database of installed packages.\n   Several switches are available to specify the type of information required.\n   See\nTable 9.1, “Essential RPM query options”\n.\nTable 9.1:\nEssential RPM query options\n#\n-i\nPackage information\n-l\nFile list\n-f FILE\nQuery the package that contains the file\nFILE\n(the full path must be specified with\nFILE\n)\n-s\nFile list with status information (implies\n-l\n)\n-d\nList only documentation files (implies\n-l\n)\n-c\nList only configuration files (implies\n-l\n)\n--dump\nFile list with complete details (to be used with\n-l\n,\n-c\n, or\n-d\n)\n--provides\nList features of the package that another package can request with\n--requires\n--requires\n,\n-R\nCapabilities the package requires\n--scripts\nInstallation scripts (preinstall, postinstall, uninstall)\nFor example, the command\nrpm -q -i wget\ndisplays the\n   information shown in\nExample 9.2, “\nrpm -q -i wget\n”\n.\nExample 9.2:\nrpm -q -i wget\n#\nName        : wget\nVersion     : 1.14\nRelease     : 17.1\nArchitecture: x86_64\nInstall Date: Mon 30 Jan 2017 14:01:29 CET\nGroup       : Productivity/Networking/Web/Utilities\nSize        : 2046483\nLicense     : GPL-3.0+\nSignature   : RSA/SHA256, Thu 08 Dec 2016 07:48:44 CET, Key ID 70af9e8139db7c82\nSource RPM  : wget-1.14-17.1.src.rpm\nBuild Date  : Thu 08 Dec 2016 07:48:34 CET\nBuild Host  : sheep09\nRelocations : (not relocatable)\nPackager    : https://www.suse.com/\nVendor      : SUSE LLC <https://www.suse.com/>\nURL         : http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/\nSummary     : A Tool for Mirroring FTP and HTTP Servers\nDescription :\nWget enables you to retrieve WWW documents or FTP files from a server.\nThis can be done in script files or via the command line.\nDistribution: SUSE Linux Enterprise 15\nThe option\n-f\nonly works if you specify the complete file\n   name with its full path.

If the partition\n/usr\nhas a size of 1 GB, this database can occupy\n   nearly 30 MB, especially after a complete update. If the database is\n   much larger than expected, it is useful to rebuild the database with the\n   option\n--rebuilddb\n. Before doing this, make a backup of the\n   old database. The\ncron\nscript\ncron.daily\nmakes daily copies of the database (packed\n   with gzip) and stores them in\n/var/adm/backup/rpmdb\n.\n   The number of copies is controlled by the variable\nMAX_RPMDB_BACKUPS\n(default:\n5\n) in\n/etc/sysconfig/backup\n. The size of a single backup is\n   approximately 1 MB for 1 GB in\n/usr\n.\n9.2.5\nInstalling and compiling source packages\n#\nAll source packages carry a\n.src.rpm\nextension (source\n   RPM).\nNote: Installed source packages\nSource packages can be copied from the installation medium to the hard disk\n    and unpacked with YaST. They are not, however, marked as installed\n    (\n[i]\n) in the package manager. This is because the source\n    packages are not entered in the RPM database. Only\ninstalled\noperating system software is listed in the\n    RPM database. When you\n“\ninstall\n”\na source package, only the\n    source code is added to the system.\nThe following directories must be available for\nrpm\nand\nrpmbuild\nin\n/usr/src/packages\n(unless you specified custom settings in a file like\n/etc/rpmrc\n):\nSOURCES\nfor the original sources (\n.tar.bz2\nor\n.tar.gz\nfiles, etc.) and for distribution-specific\n      adjustments (mostly\n.diff\nor\n.patch\nfiles)\nSPECS\nfor the\n.spec\nfiles, similar to a meta Makefile,\n      which control the\nbuild\nprocess\nBUILD\nall the sources are unpacked, patched and compiled in this directory\nRPMS\nwhere the completed binary packages are stored\nSRPMS\nhere are the source RPMs\nWhen you install a source package with YaST, all the necessary components\n   are installed in\n/usr/src/packages\n: the sources and the\n   adjustments in\nSOURCES\nand the relevant\n.spec\nfile in\nSPECS\n.\nWarning: System integrity\nDo not experiment with system components\n    (\nglibc\n,\nrpm\n, etc.), because this\n    endangers the stability of your system.\nThe following example uses the\nwget.src.rpm\npackage.\n   After installing the source package, you should have files similar to those\n   in the following list:\n/usr/src/packages/SOURCES/wget-1.19.5.tar.bz2\n/usr/src/packages/SOURCES/wgetrc.patch\n/usr/src/packages/SPECS/wget.spec\nrpmbuild\n-b\nX\n/usr/src/packages/SPECS/wget.spec\nstarts the\n   compilation.\nX\nis a wild card for various stages\n   of the build process (see the output of\n--help\nor the RPM\n   documentation for details). The following is merely a brief explanation:\n-bp\nPrepare sources in\n/usr/src/packages/BUILD\n: unpack\n      and patch.\n-bc\nDo the same as\n-bp\n, but with additional compilation.\n-bi\nDo the same as\n-bp\n, but with additional installation of\n      the built software. Caution: if the package does not support the\n      BuildRoot feature, you might overwrite configuration files.\n-bb\nDo the same as\n-bi\n, but with the additional creation of\n      the binary package. If the compile was successful, the binary should be\n      in\n/usr/src/packages/RPMS\n.\n-ba\nDo the same as\n-bb\n, but with the additional creation of\n      the source RPM. If the compilation was successful, the binary should be\n      in\n/usr/src/packages/SRPMS\n.\n--short-circuit\nSkip some steps.\nThe binary RPM created can now be installed with\nrpm\n-i\nor, preferably, with\nrpm\n-U\n. Installation with\nrpm\nmakes it\n   appear in the RPM database.\nKeep in mind that the\nBuildRoot\ndirective in the spec\n   file is deprecated. If you still need this feature, use the\n--buildroot\noption as a workaround.\n9.2.6\nCompiling RPM packages with build\n#\nThe danger with many packages is that unwanted files are added to the\n   running system during the build process. To prevent this use\nbuild\n, which creates a defined environment in which\n   the package is built. To establish this chroot environment, the\nbuild\nscript must be provided with a complete package\n   tree. This tree can be made available on the hard disk, via NFS, or from\n   DVD. Set the position with\nbuild --rpms\nDIRECTORY\n. Unlike\nrpm\n, the\nbuild\ncommand looks for the\n.spec\nfile in the source directory. To build\nwget\n(like in\n   the above example) with the DVD mounted in the system under\n/media/dvd\n, use the following commands as\nroot\n:\n#\ncd /usr/src/packages/SOURCES/\n#\nmv ../SPECS/wget.spec .\n#\nbuild --rpms /media/dvd/suse/ wget.spec\nSubsequently, a minimum environment is established at\n/var/tmp/build-root\n. The package is built in this\n   environment. Upon completion, the resulting packages are located in\n/var/tmp/build-root/usr/src/packages/RPMS\n.\nThe\nbuild\nscript offers several additional options. For\n   example, cause the script to prefer your own RPMs, omit the initialization\n   of the build environment or limit the\nrpm\ncommand to one\n   of the above-mentioned stages. Access additional information with\nbuild\n--help\nand by reading the\nbuild\nman page.\n9.2.7\nTools for RPM archives and the RPM database\n#\nMidnight Commander (\nmc\n) can display the contents of RPM\n   archives and copy parts of them. It represents archives as virtual file\n   systems, offering all usual menu options of Midnight Commander. Display the\nHEADER\nwith\nF3\n. View the archive\n   structure with the cursor keys and\nEnter\n. Copy archive\n   components with\nF5\n.\nA full-featured package manager is available as a YaST module.

For more\n    information, see\nSection 10.3, “System rollback by booting from snapshots”\n.\nThinly-provisioned LVM volumes formatted with XFS or Ext4.\nUsing Snapper, you can perform the following tasks:\nUndo system changes made by\nzypper\nand YaST. See\nSection 10.2, “Using Snapper to undo changes”\nfor details.\nRestore files from previous snapshots. See\nSection 10.2.2, “Using Snapper to restore files”\nfor details.\nDo a system rollback by booting from a snapshot. See\nSection 10.3, “System rollback by booting from snapshots”\nfor details.\nManually create and manage snapshots, within the running system. See\nSection 10.6, “Manually creating and managing snapshots”\nfor details.\n10.1\nDefault setup\n#\nSnapper on\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nis set up as an undo and recovery\n   tool for system changes. By default, the root partition\n   (\n/\n) of\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nis formatted with\nBtrfs\n. Taking snapshots is automatically enabled if the\n   root partition (\n/\n) is big enough (more\n   than approximately 16 GB). By default, snapshots are disabled on partitions\n   other than\n/\n.\nTip: Enabling Snapper in the installed system\nIf you disabled Snapper during the installation, you can enable it at\n    any time later. To do so, create a default Snapper configuration for the\n    root file system by running:\n>\nsudo\nsnapper -c root create-config /\nAfterward enable the different snapshot types as described in\nSection 10.1.4.1, “Disabling/enabling snapshots”\n.\nNote that on a Btrfs root file system, snapshots require a file system with\n    subvolumes configured as proposed by the installer and a partition size of at\n    least 16 GB.\nWhen a snapshot is created, both the snapshot and the original point to the\n   same blocks in the file system. So, initially a snapshot does not occupy\n   additional disk space. If data in the original file system is modified,\n   changed data blocks are copied while the old data blocks are kept for the\n   snapshot. Therefore, a snapshot occupies the same amount of space as the\n   data modified. So, over time, the amount of space a snapshot allocates,\n   constantly grows. As a consequence, deleting files from a\nBtrfs\nfile system containing snapshots may\nnot\nfree disk space!\nNote: Snapshot location\nSnapshots always reside on the same partition or subvolume on which the\n    snapshot has been taken. It is not possible to store snapshots on a\n    different partition or subvolume.\nAs a result, partitions containing snapshots need to be larger than\n   partitions not containing snapshots. The exact amount depends strongly on the\n   number of snapshots you keep and the amount of data modifications. As a rule\n   of thumb, give partitions twice as much space as you normally would.\n   To prevent disks from running out of space, old snapshots are automatically\n   cleaned up. Refer to\nSection 10.1.4.4, “Controlling snapshot archiving”\nfor details.\n10.1.1\nDefault settings\n#\nDisks larger than 16 GB\nConfiguration file:\n/etc/snapper/configs/root\nUSE_SNAPPER=yes\nTIMELINE_CREATE=no\nDisks smaller than 16 GB\nConfiguration file: not created\nUSE_SNAPPER=no\nTIMELINE_CREATE=yes\n10.1.2\nTypes of snapshots\n#\nAlthough snapshots themselves do not differ in a technical sense, we\n    distinguish between three types of snapshots, based on the events that trigger them:\nTimeline snapshots\nA single snapshot is created every hour. Using the YaST OS\n        installation method (default), timeline snapshots are enabled, except\n        for the root file system. You can configure timeline snapshots to be\n        taken at different intervals: hourly, daily, weekly, monthly and yearly.\n        Old snapshots are automatically deleted. By default, the first snapshot\n        of the last ten days, months and years is kept.\nInstallation snapshots\nWhenever one or more packages are installed with Zypper or YaST,\n        three installation snapshots are created. In case an important system\n        component such as the kernel has been installed, the snapshot pair is\n        marked as important. Old snapshots are automatically deleted.\n        Installation snapshots are enabled by default.\nAdministration snapshots\nWhenever you make changes to the system using Zypper or YaST, a\n         pair of snapshots is created: one prior to the system change\n         (\n“\npre\n”\n) and the other one after the system change\n         (\n“\npost\n”\n). Old snapshots are automatically deleted.\n         Administration snapshots are enabled by default.\n10.1.3\nDirectories that are excluded from snapshots\n#\nSome directories need to be excluded from snapshots for different reasons.\n    The following list shows all directories that are excluded:\n/boot/grub2/i386-pc\n,\n/boot/grub2/x86_64-efi\n,\n/boot/grub2/powerpc-ieee1275\n,\n/boot/grub2/s390x-emu\nA rollback of the boot loader configuration is not supported. The\n    directories listed above are architecture-specific. The first two\n    directories are present on AMD64/Intel 64 machines, the latter two on IBM\n    POWER and on IBM Z, respectively.\n/home\nIf\n/home\ndoes not reside on a separate partition, it\n    is excluded to avoid data loss on rollbacks.\n/opt\nThird-party products usually get installed to\n/opt\n. It\n    is excluded to avoid uninstalling these applications on rollbacks.\n/srv\nContains data for Web and FTP servers. It is excluded to avoid data loss on\n    rollbacks.\n/tmp\nAll directories containing temporary files and caches are excluded from\n    snapshots.\n/usr/local\nThis directory is used when manually installing software. It is excluded to\n    avoid uninstalling these installations on rollbacks.\n/var\nThis directory contains many variable files, including logs, temporary\n    caches, third party products in\n/var/opt\n, and is the\n    default location for virtual machine images and databases. Therefore this\n    subvolume is created to exclude all of this variable data from snapshots\n    and has Copy-On-Write disabled.\n10.1.4\nCustomizing the setup\n#\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\ncomes with a reasonable default setup, which should be\n    sufficient for most use cases. However, all aspects of taking automatic\n    snapshots and snapshot keeping can be configured according to your needs.\n10.1.4.1\nDisabling/enabling snapshots\n#\nEach of the three snapshot types (timeline, installation, administration)\n     can be enabled or disabled independently.\nDisabling/enabling timeline snapshots\nEnabling.\nsnapper -c root set-config \"TIMELINE_CREATE=yes\"\nDisabling.\nsnapper -c root set-config \"TIMELINE_CREATE=no\"\nUsing the YaST OS installation method (default), timeline snapshots\n        are enabled, except for the root file system.\nDisabling/enabling installation snapshots\nEnabling:\nInstall the package\nsnapper-zypp-plugin\nDisabling:\nUninstall the package\nsnapper-zypp-plugin\nInstallation snapshots are enabled by default.\nDisabling/enabling administration snapshots\nEnabling:\nSet\nUSE_SNAPPER\nto\nyes\nin\n/etc/sysconfig/yast2\n.\nDisabling:\nSet\nUSE_SNAPPER\nto\nno\nin\n/etc/sysconfig/yast2\n.\nAdministration snapshots are enabled by default.\n10.1.4.2\nControlling installation snapshots\n#\nTaking snapshot pairs upon installing packages with YaST or Zypper is\n     handled by the\nsnapper-zypp-plugin\n. An XML\n     configuration file,\n/etc/snapper/zypp-plugin.conf\ndefines, when to make snapshots. By default the file looks like the\n     following:\n1 <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n 2 <snapper-zypp-plugin-conf>\n 3  <solvables>\n 4   <solvable match=\"w\"\n1\nimportant=\"true\"\n2\n>kernel-*\n3\n</solvable>\n 5   <solvable match=\"w\" important=\"true\">dracut</solvable>\n 6   <solvable match=\"w\" important=\"true\">glibc</solvable>\n 7   <solvable match=\"w\" important=\"true\">systemd*</solvable>\n 8   <solvable match=\"w\" important=\"true\">udev</solvable>\n 9   <solvable match=\"w\">*</solvable>\n4\n10  </solvables>\n11 </snapper-zypp-plugin-conf>\n1\nThe match attribute defines whether the pattern is a Unix shell-style\n       wild card (\nw\n) or a Python regular expression\n       (\nre\n).\n2\nIf the given pattern matches and the corresponding package is marked as\n       important (for example kernel packages), the snapshot will also be\n       marked as important.\n3\nPattern to match a package name. Based on the setting of the\nmatch\nattribute, special characters are either\n       interpreted as shell wild cards or regular expressions. This pattern\n       matches all package names starting with\nkernel-\n.\n4\nThis line unconditionally matches all packages.\nWith this configuration snapshot, pairs are made whenever a package is\n     installed (line 9). When the kernel, dracut, glibc, systemd, or udev packages\n     marked as important are installed, the snapshot pair will also be marked\n     as important (lines 4 to 8). All rules are evaluated.\nTo disable a rule, either delete it or deactivate it using XML comments.\n     To prevent the system from making snapshot pairs for every package\n     installation for example, comment line 9:\n1 <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n 2 <snapper-zypp-plugin-conf>\n 3  <solvables>\n 4   <solvable match=\"w\" important=\"true\">kernel-*</solvable>\n 5   <solvable match=\"w\" important=\"true\">dracut</solvable>\n 6   <solvable match=\"w\" important=\"true\">glibc</solvable>\n 7   <solvable match=\"w\" important=\"true\">systemd*</solvable>\n 8   <solvable match=\"w\" important=\"true\">udev</solvable>\n 9   <!-- <solvable match=\"w\">*</solvable> -->\n10  </solvables>\n11 </snapper-zypp-plugin-conf>\n10.1.4.3\nCreating and mounting new subvolumes\n#\nCreating a new subvolume underneath the\n/\nhierarchy\n     and permanently mounting it is supported. Such a subvolume will be\n     excluded from snapshots. You need to make sure not to create it inside an\n     existing snapshot, since you would not be able to delete snapshots anymore\n     after a rollback.\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nis configured with the\n/@/\nsubvolume\n     which serves as an independent root for permanent subvolumes such as\n/opt\n,\n/srv\n,\n/home\nand others. Any new subvolumes you create and\n     permanently mount need to be created in this initial root file system.\nTo do so, run the following commands. In this example, a new subvolume\n/usr/important\nis created from\n/dev/sda2\n.\n>\nsudo\nmount /dev/sda2 -o subvol=@ /mnt\n>\nsudo\nbtrfs subvolume create /mnt/usr/important\n>\nsudo\numount /mnt\nThe corresponding entry in\n/etc/fstab\nneeds to look\n     like the following:\n/dev/sda2 /usr/important btrfs subvol=@/usr/important 0 0\nTip: Disable copy-on-write (cow)\nA subvolume may contain files that constantly change, such as\n      virtualized disk images, database files, or log files. If so, consider\n      disabling the copy-on-write feature for this volume, to avoid duplication\n      of disk blocks. Use the\nnodatacow\nmount option in\n/etc/fstab\nto do so:\n/dev/sda2 /usr/important btrfs nodatacow,subvol=@/usr/important 0 0\nTo alternatively disable copy-on-write for single files or directories,\n      use the command\nchattr +C\nPATH\n.\n10.1.4.4\nControlling snapshot archiving\n#\nSnapshots occupy disk space. To prevent disks from running out of space\n     and thus causing system outages, old snapshots are automatically deleted.\n     By default, up to ten important installation and administration snapshots\n     and up to ten regular installation and administration snapshots are kept.\n     If these snapshots occupy more than 50% of the root file system size,\n     additional snapshots will be deleted. A minimum of four important and two\n     regular snapshots are always kept.\nRefer to\nSection 10.5.1, “Managing existing configurations”\nfor instructions on\n     how to change these values.\n10.1.4.5\nUsing Snapper on thinly provisioned LVM volumes\n#\nApart from snapshots on\nBtrfs\nfile systems, Snapper\n     also supports taking snapshots on thinly-provisioned LVM volumes (snapshots\n     on regular LVM volumes are\nnot\nsupported) formatted\n     with XFS, Ext4 or Ext3. For more information and setup instructions on LVM\n     volumes, refer to\nSection 10.2, “LVM configuration”\n.\nTo use Snapper on a thinly-provisioned LVM volume you need to create a\n     Snapper configuration for it. On LVM it is required to specify the file\n     system with\n--fstype=lvm(\nFILESYSTEM\n)\n.\next3\n,\netx4\nor\nxfs\nare valid values for\nFILESYSTEM\n. Example:\n>\nsudo\nsnapper -c lvm create-config --fstype=\"lvm(xfs)\" /thin_lvm\nYou can adjust this configuration according to your needs as described in\nSection 10.5.1, “Managing existing configurations”\n.\n10.2\nUsing Snapper to undo changes\n#\nSnapper on\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nis preconfigured to serve as a tool that lets you\n   undo changes made by\nzypper\nand YaST. For this purpose,\n   Snapper is configured to create a pair of snapshots before and after each\n   run of\nzypper\nand YaST. Snapper also lets you restore\n   system files that have been accidentally deleted or modified. Timeline\n   snapshots for the root partition need to be enabled for this\n   purpose—see\nSection 10.1.4.1, “Disabling/enabling snapshots”\nfor details.\nBy default, automatic snapshots as described above are configured for the\n   root partition and its subvolumes. To make snapshots available for other\n   partitions such as\n/home\nfor example, you can create\n   custom configurations.\nImportant: Undoing changes compared to rollback\nWhen working with snapshots to restore data, it is important to know that\n    there are two fundamentally different scenarios Snapper can handle:\nUndoing changes\nWhen undoing changes as described in the following, two snapshots are\n       being compared and the changes between these two snapshots are made\n       undone. Using this method also allows to explicitly select the files\n       that should be restored.\nRollback\nWhen doing rollbacks as described in\nSection 10.3, “System rollback by booting from snapshots”\n, the system is reset to the\n       state at which the snapshot was taken.\nWhen undoing changes, it is also possible to compare a snapshot against the\n    current system. When restoring\nall\nfiles from such a\n    comparison, this will have the same result as doing a rollback. However,\n    using the method described in\nSection 10.3, “System rollback by booting from snapshots”\nfor rollbacks should be preferred, since it is faster and allows you to\n    review the system before doing the rollback.\nWarning: Data consistency\nThere is no mechanism to ensure data consistency when creating a snapshot.\n    Whenever a file (for example, a database) is written at the same time as\n    the snapshot is being created, it will result in a corrupted or partly written\n    file. Restoring such a file will cause problems. Furthermore, some system\n    files such as\n/etc/mtab\nmust never be restored.\n    Therefore it is strongly recommended to\nalways\nclosely\n    review the list of changed files and their diffs. Only restore files that\n    really belong to the action you want to revert.\n10.2.1\nUndoing YaST and Zypper changes\n#\nIf you set up the root partition with\nBtrfs\nduring the\n    installation, Snapper—preconfigured for doing rollbacks of YaST or\n    Zypper changes—will automatically be installed. Every time you start\n    a YaST module or a Zypper transaction, two snapshots are created: a\n“\npre-snapshot\n”\ncapturing the state of the file system before\n    the start of the module and a\n“\npost-snapshot\n”\nafter the module\n    has been finished.\nUsing the YaST Snapper module or the\nsnapper\ncommand\n    line tool, you can undo the changes made by YaST/Zypper by restoring\n    files from the\n“\npre-snapshot\n”\n. Comparing two snapshots the\n    tools also allow you to see which files have been changed. You can also\n    display the differences between two versions of a file (diff).\nProcedure 10.1:\nUndoing changes using the YaST\nSnapper\nmodule\n#\nStart the\nSnapper\nmodule from the\nMiscellaneous\nsection in YaST or by entering\nyast2 snapper\n.\nMake sure\nCurrent Configuration\nis set to\nroot\n. This is always the case unless you have manually\n      added own Snapper configurations.\nChoose a pair of pre- and post-snapshots from the list. Both, YaST and\n      Zypper snapshot pairs are of the type\nPre & Post\n.\n      YaST snapshots are labeled as\nzypp(y2base)\nin the\nDescription column\n; Zypper snapshots are labeled\nzypp(zypper)\n.\nClick\nShow Changes\nto open the list of files that\n      differ between the two snapshots.\nReview the list of files. To display a\n“\ndiff\n”\nbetween the\n      pre- and post-version of a file, select it from the list.\nTo restore one or more files, select the relevant files or directories by\n      activating the respective check box. Click\nRestore\n      Selected\nand confirm the action by clicking\nYes\n.\nTo restore a single file, activate its diff view by clicking its name.\n      Click\nRestore From First\nand confirm your choice with\nYes\n.\nProcedure 10.2:\nUndoing changes using the\nsnapper\ncommand\n#\nGet a list of YaST and Zypper snapshots by running\nsnapper\n      list -t pre-post\n.

Since certain directories are excluded from snapshots, files\n     belonging to these users will remain in the file system. If a user with\n     the same user ID as a deleted user is created, this user will inherit the\n     files. Therefore it is strongly recommended to use the YaST\nUser and Group Management\ntool to remove users.\n10.2.2\nUsing Snapper to restore files\n#\nApart from the installation and administration snapshots, Snapper creates\n    timeline snapshots. You can use these backup snapshots to restore files\n    that have accidentally been deleted or to restore a previous version of a\n    file. By using Snapper's diff feature you can also find out which\n    modifications have been made at a certain point of time.\nBeing able to restore files is especially interesting for data, which may\n    reside on subvolumes or partitions for which snapshots are not taken by\n    default. To be able to restore files from home directories, for example,\n    create a separate Snapper configuration for\n/home\ndoing automatic timeline snapshots. See\nSection 10.5, “Creating and modifying Snapper configurations”\nfor instructions.\nWarning: Restoring files compared to rollback\nSnapshots taken from the root file system (defined by Snapper's root\n     configuration), can be used to do a system rollback. The recommended way\n     to do such a rollback is to boot from the snapshot and then perform the\n     rollback. See\nSection 10.3, “System rollback by booting from snapshots”\nfor details.\nPerforming a rollback would also be possible by restoring all files from a\n     root file system snapshot as described below. However, this is not\n     recommended. You may restore single files, for example a configuration\n     file from the\n/etc\ndirectory, but not the\n     complete list of files from the snapshot.\nThis restriction only affects snapshots taken from the root file system!\nProcedure 10.3:\nRestoring files using the YaST\nSnapper\nmodule\n#\nStart the\nSnapper\nmodule from the\nMiscellaneous\nsection in YaST or by entering\nyast2 snapper\n.\nChoose the\nCurrent Configuration\nfrom which to choose\n      a snapshot.\nSelect a timeline snapshot from which to restore a file and choose\nShow Changes\n. Timeline snapshots are of the type\nSingle\nwith a description value of\ntimeline\n.\nSelect a file from the text box by clicking the file name. The difference\n      between the snapshot version and the current system is shown. Activate\n      the check box to select the file for restore. Do so for all files you\n      want to restore.\nClick\nRestore Selected\nand confirm the action by\n      clicking\nYes\n.\nProcedure 10.4:\nRestoring files using the\nsnapper\ncommand\n#\nGet a list of timeline snapshots for a specific configuration by running\n      the following command:\n>\nsudo\nsnapper -c\nCONFIG\nlist -t single | grep timeline\nCONFIG\nneeds to be replaced by an existing\n      Snapper configuration.

Only snapshots created for the default Snapper\n   configuration (\nroot\n) are bootable.\nImportant: Supported configuration\nAs of\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n15 SP4\nsystem rollbacks are only supported if\n    the default subvolume configuration of the root partition has not been\n    changed.\nWhen booting a snapshot, the parts of the file system included in the\n   snapshot are mounted read-only; all other file systems and parts that are\n   excluded from snapshots are mounted read-write and can be modified.\nImportant: Undoing changes compared to rollback\nWhen working with snapshots to restore data, it is important to know that\n    there are two fundamentally different scenarios Snapper can handle:\nUndoing changes\nWhen undoing changes as described in\nSection 10.2, “Using Snapper to undo changes”\n,\n       two snapshots are compared and the changes between these two snapshots\n       are reverted. Using this method also allows to explicitly exclude\n       selected files from being restored.\nRollback\nWhen doing rollbacks as described in the following, the system is reset\n       to the state at which the snapshot was taken.\nTo do a rollback from a bootable snapshot, the following requirements must\n   be met. When doing a default installation, the system is set up accordingly.\nRequirements for a rollback from a bootable snapshot\n#\nThe root file system needs to be Btrfs. Booting from LVM volume snapshots\n     is not supported.\nThe root file system needs to be on a single device. To check, run\nsudo /sbin/btrfs filesystem show\n. It needs to report\nTotal devices 1\n. If more than\n1\ndevice is listed, your setup is not supported.\nNote: Directories excluded from snapshots\nDirectories that are excluded from snapshots such as\n/srv\n(see\nSection 10.1.3, “Directories that are excluded from snapshots”\nfor a full list) may reside on separate devices.\nThe system needs to be bootable via the installed boot loader.\nOnly contents of the subvolume\n/\nwill be rolled\n     back. It is not possible to include other subvolumes.\nTo perform a rollback from a bootable snapshot, do as follows:\nBoot the system. In the boot menu choose\nBootable\n     snapshots\nand select the snapshot you want to boot. The list of\n     snapshots is listed by date—the most recent snapshot is listed\n     first.\nLog in to the system. Carefully check whether everything works as\n     expected. Note that you cannot write to any directory that is part of the\n     snapshot. Data you write to other directories will\nnot\nget lost, regardless of what you do next.\nDepending on whether you want to perform the rollback or not, choose your\n     next step:\nIf the system is in a state where you do not want to do a rollback,\n       reboot to boot into the current system state. You can then choose a different\n       snapshot, or start the rescue system.\nTo perform the rollback, run\n>\nsudo\nsnapper rollback\nand reboot afterward. On the boot screen, choose the default boot entry\n       to reboot into the reinstated system. A snapshot of the file system status\n       before the rollback is created. The default subvolume for root will\n       be replaced with a fresh read-write snapshot.\n       For details, see\nSection 10.3.1, “Snapshots after rollback”\n.\nIt is useful to add a description for the snapshot with the\n-d\noption.\n        For example:\nNew file system root since rollback on\nDATE\nTIME\nTip: Rolling back to a specific installation state\nIf snapshots are not disabled during installation, an initial bootable\n    snapshot is created at the end of the initial system installation. You can\n    go back to that state at any time by booting this snapshot. The snapshot\n    can be identified by the description\nafter installation\n.\nA bootable snapshot is also created when starting a system upgrade to a\n    service pack or a new major release (provided snapshots are not disabled).\n10.3.1\nSnapshots after rollback\n#\nBefore a rollback is performed, a snapshot of the running file system\n    is created. The description references the ID of the snapshot that\n    was restored in the rollback.\nSnapshots created by rollbacks receive the value\nnumber\nfor the\nCleanup\nattribute. The rollback snapshots are\n    therefore automatically deleted when the set number of snapshots is reached.\n    Refer to\nSection 10.7, “Automatic snapshot clean-up”\nfor details.\n    If the snapshot contains important data, extract the data from the snapshot\n    before it is removed.\n10.3.1.1\nExample of rollback snapshot\n#\nFor example, after a fresh installation the following snapshots are\n     available on the system:\n#\nsnapper\n--iso list\nType   | # |     | Cleanup | Description           | Userdata\n-------+---+ ... +---------+-----------------------+--------------\nsingle | 0 |     |         | current               |\nsingle | 1 |     |         | first root filesystem |\nsingle | 2 |     | number  | after installation    | important=yes\nAfter running\nsudo snapper rollback\nsnapshot\n3\nis created and contains the state of the system\n     before the rollback was executed. Snapshot\n4\nis\n     the new default Btrfs subvolume and thus the system after a reboot.\n#\nsnapper\n--iso list\nType   | # |     | Cleanup | Description           | Userdata\n-------+---+ ... +---------+-----------------------+--------------\nsingle | 0 |     |         | current               |\nsingle | 1 |     | number  | first root filesystem |\nsingle | 2 |     | number  | after installation    | important=yes\nsingle | 3 |     | number  | rollback backup of #1 | important=yes\nsingle | 4 |     |         |                       |\n10.3.2\nAccessing and identifying snapshot boot entries\n#\nTo boot from a snapshot, reboot your machine and choose\nStart\n    Bootloader from a read-only snapshot\n. A screen listing all\n    bootable snapshots opens. The most recent snapshot is listed first, the\n    oldest last. Use the keys\n↓\nand\n↑\nto navigate and press\nEnter\nto\n    activate the selected snapshot. Activating a snapshot from the boot menu\n    does not reboot the machine immediately, but rather opens the boot loader\n    of the selected snapshot.\nFigure 10.1:\nBoot loader: snapshots\n#\nWarning: Booting Xen from a Btrfs snapshot using UEFI currently fails\nRefer to\nhttps://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000020602\nfor more\n     details.\nEach snapshot entry in the boot loader follows a naming scheme which makes\n    it possible to identify it easily:\n[*]\n1\nOS\n2\n(\nKERNEL\n3\n,\nDATE\n4\nT\nTIME\n5\n,\nDESCRIPTION\n6\n)\n1\nIf the snapshot was marked\nimportant\n, the entry is\n      marked with a\n*\n.\n2\nOperating system label.\n4\nDate in the format\nYYYY-MM-DD\n.\n5\nTime in the format\nHH:MM\n.\n6\nThis field contains a description of the snapshot. In case of a manually\n      created snapshot this is the string created with the option\n--description\nor a custom string (see\nTip: Setting a custom description for boot loader snapshot entries\n). In case\n      of an automatically created snapshot, it is the tool that was called, for\n      example\nzypp(zypper)\nor\nyast_sw_single\n. Long descriptions may be truncated,\n      depending on the size of the boot screen.\nTip: Setting a custom description for boot loader snapshot entries\nIt is possible to replace the default string in the description field of a\n     snapshot with a custom string. This is for example useful if an\n     automatically created description is not sufficient, or a user-provided\n     description is too long. To set a custom string\nSTRING\nfor snapshot\nNUMBER\n, use the following command:\n>\nsudo\nsnapper modify --userdata \"bootloader=\nSTRING\n\"\nNUMBER\nThe description should be no longer than 25 characters—everything\n     that exceeds this size will not be readable on the boot screen.\n10.3.3\nLimitations\n#\nA\ncomplete\nsystem rollback, restoring the complete\n    system to the identical state as it was in when a snapshot was taken, is\n    not possible.\n10.3.3.1\nDirectories excluded from snapshots\n#\nRoot file system snapshots do not contain all directories. See\nSection 10.1.3, “Directories that are excluded from snapshots”\nfor details and reasons. As a\n     general consequence, data from these directories is not restored,\n     resulting in the following limitations.\nAdd-ons and third-party software may be unusable after a rollback\nApplications and add-ons installing data in subvolumes excluded from\n        the snapshot, such as\n/opt\n, may not work after a\n        rollback, if others parts of the application data are also installed on\n        subvolumes included in the snapshot. Re-install the application or the\n        add-on to solve this problem.\nFile access problems\nIf an application had changed file permissions and/or ownership in\n        between snapshot and current system, the application may not be able to\n        access these files. Reset permissions and/or ownership for the affected\n        files after the rollback.\nIncompatible data formats\nIf a service or an application has established a new data format in\n        between snapshot and current system, the application may not be able to\n        read the affected data files after a rollback.\nSubvolumes with a mixture of code and data\nSubvolumes like\n/srv\nmay contain a mixture of code\n        and data. A rollback may result in non-functional code. A downgrade of\n        the PHP version, for example, may result in broken PHP scripts for the\n        Web server.\nUser data\nIf a rollback removes users from the system, data that is owned by\n        these users in directories excluded from the snapshot, is not removed.\n        If a user with the same user ID is created, this user will inherit the\n        files. Use a tool like\nfind\nto locate and remove\n        orphaned files.\n10.3.3.2\nNo rollback of boot loader data\n#\nA rollback of the boot loader is not possible, since all\n“\nstages\n”\nof the boot loader must fit together. This cannot be\n     guaranteed when doing rollbacks of\n/boot\n.\n10.4\nEnabling Snapper in user home directories\n#\nYou may enable snapshots for users'\n/home\ndirectories, which supports a number of use cases:\nIndividual users may manage their own snapshots and rollbacks.\nSystem users, for example database, system, and network admins\n                 who want to track copies of configuration files, documentation, \n                 and so on.\nSamba shares with home directories and Btrfs back-end.\nEach user's directory is a Btrfs subvolume of\n/home\n.         \n         It is possible to set this up manually \n         (see\nSection 10.4.3, “Manually enabling snapshots in home directories”\n). However, a \n         more convenient way is to use\npam_snapper\n.\n         The\npam_snapper\npackage installs the\npam_snapper.so\nmodule and helper scripts, which \n         automate user creation and Snapper configuration.\npam_snapper\nprovides integration with the\nuseradd\ncommand, pluggable\n         authentication modules (PAM), and Snapper. By default it creates snapshots\n         at user login and logout, and also creates time-based snapshots as some\n         users remain logged in for extended periods of time. You may change the\n         defaults using the normal Snapper commands and configuration files.\n10.4.1\nInstalling pam_snapper and creating users\n#\nThe easiest way is to start with a new\n/home\ndirectory formatted with Btrfs, and no existing users. Install\npam_snapper\n:\n#\nzypper in pam_snapper\nAdd this line to\n/etc/pam.d/common-session\n:\nsession optional pam_snapper.so\nUse the\n/usr/lib/pam_snapper/pam_snapper_useradd.sh\nscript to create a new user and home directory. By default the script\n             performs a dry run. Edit the script to change\nDRYRUN=1\nto\nDRYRUN=0\n. Now you\n             can create a new user:\n#\n/usr/lib/pam_snapper/pam_snapper_useradd.sh \\\nusername\ngroup\npasswd=\npassword\nCreate subvolume '/home/username'\nuseradd: warning: the home directory already exists.\nNot copying any file from skel directory into it.\nThe files from\n/etc/skel\nwill be copied\n             into the user's home directory at their first login. Verify that\n             the user's configuration was created by listing your Snapper \n             configurations:\n#\nsnapper list --all\nConfig: home_username, subvolume: /home/username\nType   | # | Pre # | Date | User | Cleanup | Description | Userdata\n-------+---+-------+------+------+---------+-------------+---------\nsingle | 0 |       |      | root |         | current     |\nOver time, this output will become populated with a list of snapshots,\n            which the user can manage with the standard Snapper commands.\n10.4.2\nRemoving users\n#\nRemove users with the\n/usr/lib/pam_snapper/pam_snapper_userdel.sh\nscript. By default it performs a dry run, so edit it to change\nDRYRUN=1\nto\nDRYRUN=0\n. This \n             removes the user, the user's home subvolume, Snapper configuration, \n             and deletes all snapshots.\n#\n/usr/lib/pam_snapper/pam_snapper_userdel.sh username\n10.4.3\nManually enabling snapshots in home directories\n#\nThese are the steps for manually setting up users' home directories\n            with Snapper.\n/home\nmust be formatted with Btrfs,\n            and the users not yet created.\n#\nbtrfs subvol create /home/\nusername\n#\nsnapper -c home_\nusername\ncreate-config /home/\nusername\n#\nsed -i -e \"s/ALLOW_USERS=\\\"\\\"/ALLOW_USERS=\\\"\nusername\n\\\"/g\" \\\n/etc/snapper/configs/home_\nusername\n#\nyast users add username=\nusername\nhome=/home/\nusername\npassword=\npassword\n#\nchown\nusername\n.\ngroup\n/home/\nusername\n#\nchmod 755 /home/\nusername\n/.snapshots\n10.5\nCreating and modifying Snapper configurations\n#\nThe way Snapper behaves is defined in a configuration file that is specific\n   for each partition or\nBtrfs\nsubvolume. These\n   configuration files reside under\n/etc/snapper/configs/\n.\nIn case the root file system is big enough (approximately 12 GB), snapshots\n   are automatically enabled for the root file system\n/\nupon installation. The corresponding default configuration is named\nroot\n. It creates and manages the YaST and Zypper\n   snapshot. See\nSection 10.5.1.1, “Configuration data”\nfor a list\n   of the default values.\nNote: Minimum root file system size for enabling snapshots\nAs explained in\nSection 10.1, “Default setup”\n, enabling snapshots\n    requires additional free space in the root file system. The amount depends\n    on the amount of packages installed and the amount of changes made to the\n    volume that is included in snapshots. The snapshot frequency and the number\n    of snapshots that get archived also matter.\nThere is a minimum root file system size that is required to automatically\n    enable snapshots during the installation. Currently this size is\n    approximately 12 GB. This value may change in the future, depending on\n    architecture and the size of the base system. It depends on the values for\n    the following tags in the file\n/control.xml\nfrom the\n    installation media:\n<root_base_size>\n<btrfs_increase_percentage>\nIt is calculated with the following formula:\nROOT_BASE_SIZE\n* (1 +\nBTRFS_INCREASE_PERCENTAGE\n/100)\nKeep in mind that this value is a minimum size. Consider using more space\n    for the root file system. As a rule of thumb, double the size you would use\n    when not having enabled snapshots.\nYou may create your own configurations for other partitions formatted with\nBtrfs\nor existing subvolumes on a\nBtrfs\npartition. In the following example we will set up\n   a Snapper configuration for backing up the Web server data residing on a\n   separate,\nBtrfs\n-formatted partition mounted at\n/srv/www\n.\nAfter a configuration has been created, you can either use\nsnapper\nitself or the YaST\nSnapper\nmodule to restore files from these snapshots. In YaST you need to select\n   your\nCurrent Configuration\n, while you need to specify\n   your configuration for\nsnapper\nwith the global switch\n-c\n(for example,\nsnapper -c myconfig\n   list\n).\nTo create a new Snapper configuration, run\nsnapper\n   create-config\n:\n>\nsudo\nsnapper -c www-data\n1\ncreate-config /srv/www\n2\n1\nName of configuration file.\n2\nMount point of the partition or\nBtrfs\nsubvolume on\n     which to take snapshots.\nThis command will create a new configuration file\n/etc/snapper/configs/www-data\nwith reasonable default\n   values (taken from\n/etc/snapper/config-templates/default\n). Refer to\nSection 10.5.1, “Managing existing configurations”\nfor instructions on how to\n   adjust these defaults.\nTip: Configuration defaults\nDefault values for a new configuration are taken from\n/etc/snapper/config-templates/default\n. To use your own\n    set of defaults, create a copy of this file in the same directory and\n    adjust it to your needs. To use it, specify the\n-t\noption\n    with the create-config command:\n>\nsudo\nsnapper -c www-data create-config -t\nMY_DEFAULTS\n/srv/www\n10.5.1\nManaging existing configurations\n#\nThe\nsnapper\ncommand offers several subcommands for managing\n    existing configurations. You can list, show, delete and modify them:\nListing configurations\nUse the subcommand\nsnapper list-configs\nto get all\n       existing configurations:\n>\nsudo\nsnapper list-configs\nConfig | Subvolume\n-------+----------\nroot   | /\nusr    | /usr\nlocal  | /local\nShowing a configuration\nUse the subcommand\nsnapper -c\nCONFIG\nget-config\nto display the\n       specified configuration. Replace\nCONFIG\nwith\n       one of the configuration names shown by\nsnapper list-configs\n.\n       For more information about the configuration options, see\nSection 10.5.1.1, “Configuration data”\n.\nTo display the default configuration, run:\n>\nsudo\nsnapper -c root get-config\nModifying a configuration\nUse the subcommand\nsnapper -c\nCONFIG\nset-config\nOPTION\n=\nVALUE\nto modify an option in the specified configuration.\n       Replace\nCONFIG\nwith one of the\n       configuration names shown by\nsnapper list-configs\n.\n       Possible values for\nOPTION\nand\nVALUE\nare listed in\nSection 10.5.1.1, “Configuration data”\n.\nDeleting a configuration\nUse the subcommand\nsnapper -c\nCONFIG\ndelete-config\nto delete a\n       configuration. Replace\nCONFIG\nwith one of the\n       configuration names shown by\nsnapper list-configs\n.\n10.5.1.1\nConfiguration data\n#\nEach configuration contains a list of options that can be modified from\n     the command line. The following list provides details for each option. To\n     change a value, run\nsnapper -c\nCONFIG\nset-config\n     \"\nKEY\n=\nVALUE\n\"\n.\nALLOW_GROUPS\n,\nALLOW_USERS\nGranting permissions to use snapshots to regular users. See\nSection 10.5.1.2, “Using Snapper as regular user”\nfor more information.\nThe default value is\n\"\"\n.\nBACKGROUND_COMPARISON\nDefines whether pre and post snapshots should be compared in the\n        background after creation.\nThe default value is\n\"yes\"\n.\nEMPTY_*\nDefines the clean-up algorithm for snapshots pairs with identical pre\n        and post snapshots. See\nSection 10.7.3, “Cleaning up snapshot pairs that do not differ”\nfor details.\nFSTYPE\nFile system type of the partition. Do not change.\nThe default value is\n\"btrfs\"\n.\nNUMBER_*\nDefines the clean-up algorithm for installation and admin snapshots.\n        See\nSection 10.7.1, “Cleaning up numbered snapshots”\nfor details.\nQGROUP\n/\nSPACE_LIMIT\nAdds quota support to the clean-up algorithms. See\nSection 10.7.5, “Adding disk quota support”\nfor details.\nSUBVOLUME\nMount point of the partition or subvolume to snapshot. Do not change.\nThe default value is\n\"/\"\n.\nSYNC_ACL\nIf Snapper is used by regular users (see\nSection 10.5.1.2, “Using Snapper as regular user”\n), the users must be able to\n        access the\n.snapshot\ndirectories and to read files\n        within them. If SYNC_ACL is set to\nyes\n, Snapper\n        automatically makes them accessible using ACLs for users and groups\n        from the ALLOW_USERS or ALLOW_GROUPS entries.\nThe default value is\n\"no\"\n.\nTIMELINE_CREATE\nIf set to\nyes\n, hourly snapshots are created. Valid\n        values:\nyes\n,\nno\n.\nThe default value is\n\"no\"\n.\nTIMELINE_CLEANUP\n/\nTIMELINE_LIMIT_*\nDefines the clean-up algorithm for timeline snapshots. See\nSection 10.7.2, “Cleaning up timeline snapshots”\nfor details.\n10.5.1.2\nUsing Snapper as regular user\n#\nBy default Snapper can only be used by\nroot\n. However, there are\n     cases in which certain groups or users need to be able to create snapshots\n     or undo changes by reverting to a snapshot:\nWeb site administrators who want to take snapshots of\n/srv/www\nUsers who want to take a snapshot of their home directory\nFor these purposes, you can create Snapper configurations that grant\n     permissions to users or/and groups. The corresponding\n.snapshots\ndirectory needs to be readable and\n     accessible by the specified users. The easiest way to achieve this is to\n     set the SYNC_ACL option to\nyes\n.\nProcedure 10.5:\nEnabling regular users to use Snapper\n#\nNote that all steps in this procedure need to be run by\nroot\n.\nIf a Snapper configuration does not exist yet, create one for the partition or\n       subvolume on which the user should be able to use Snapper. Refer to\nSection 10.5, “Creating and modifying Snapper configurations”\nfor instructions. Example:\n>\nsudo\nsnapper --config web_data create /srv/www\nThe configuration file is created under\n/etc/snapper/configs/\nCONFIG\n,\n       where CONFIG is the value you specified with\n-c/--config\nin the previous step (for example\n/etc/snapper/configs/web_data\n). Adjust it according\n       to your needs. For more information, see\nSection 10.5.1, “Managing existing configurations”\n.\nSet values for\nALLOW_USERS\nand/or\nALLOW_GROUPS\nto grant permissions to users and/or groups,\n       respectively. Multiple entries need to be separated by\nSpace\n. To grant permissions to the user\nwww_admin\nfor example, run:\n>\nsudo\nsnapper -c web_data set-config \"ALLOW_USERS=www_admin\" SYNC_ACL=\"yes\"\nThe given Snapper configuration can now be used by the specified user(s)\n       and/or group(s). You can test it with the\nlist\ncommand, for example:\nwww_admin:~ >\nsnapper -c web_data list\n10.6\nManually creating and managing snapshots\n#\nSnapper is not restricted to creating and managing snapshots automatically\n   by configuration; you can also create snapshot pairs (\n“\nbefore and\n   after\n”\n) or single snapshots manually using either the command-line\n   tool or the YaST module.\nAll Snapper operations are carried out for an existing configuration (see\nSection 10.5, “Creating and modifying Snapper configurations”\nfor details). You can only take\n   snapshots of partitions or volumes for which a configuration exists. By\n   default the system configuration (\nroot\n) is used.\n   To create or manage snapshots for your own configuration you need to\n   explicitly choose it. Use the\nCurrent Configuration\ndrop-down box in YaST or specify the\n-c\non the command\n   line (\nsnapper -c\nMYCONFIG\nCOMMAND\n).\n10.6.1\nSnapshot metadata\n#\nEach snapshot consists of the snapshot itself and some metadata. When\n    creating a snapshot you also need to specify the metadata. Modifying a\n    snapshot means changing its metadata—you cannot modify its content.\n    Use\nsnapper list\nto show existing snapshots and their\n    metadata:\nsnapper --config home list\nLists snapshots for the configuration\nhome\n. To list\n       snapshots for the default configuration (root), use\nsnapper -c\n       root list\nor\nsnapper list\n.\nsnapper list -a\nLists snapshots for all existing configurations.\nsnapper list -t pre-post\nLists all pre and post snapshot pairs for the default\n       (\nroot\n) configuration.\nsnapper list -t single\nLists all snapshots of the type\nsingle\nfor the\n       default (\nroot\n) configuration.\nThe following metadata is available for each snapshot:\nType\n: Snapshot type, see\nSection 10.6.1.1, “Snapshot types”\nfor details. This data\n      cannot be changed.\nNumber\n: Unique number of the snapshot.\n      This data cannot be changed.\nPre Number\n: Specifies the number of the\n      corresponding pre snapshot. For snapshots of type post only. This data\n      cannot be changed.\nDescription\n: A description of the\n      snapshot.\nUserdata\n: An extended description where\n      you can specify custom data in the form of a comma-separated key=value\n      list:\nreason=testing, project=foo\n. This field is also\n      used to mark a snapshot as important (\nimportant=yes\n)\n      and to list the user that created the snapshot\n      (user=tux).\nCleanup-Algorithm\n: Cleanup-algorithm for\n      the snapshot, see\nSection 10.7, “Automatic snapshot clean-up”\nfor details.\n10.6.1.1\nSnapshot types\n#\nSnapper knows three different types of snapshots: pre, post, and single.\n     Physically they do not differ, but Snapper handles them differently.\npre\nSnapshot of a file system\nbefore\na modification.\n        Each\npre\nsnapshot corresponds to a\npost\nsnapshot.\n        For example, this is used for the automatic YaST/Zypper snapshots.\npost\nSnapshot of a file system\nafter\na modification.\n        Each\npost\nsnapshot corresponds to a\npre\nsnapshot.\n        For example, this is used for the automatic YaST/Zypper snapshots.\nsingle\nStand-alone snapshot.\n        For example, this is used for the automatic hourly snapshots.\n        This is the default type when creating snapshots.\n10.6.1.2\nCleanup algorithms\n#\nSnapper provides three algorithms to clean up old snapshots. The\n     algorithms are executed in a daily\ncron\njob.\n     It is possible to define the\n     number of different types of snapshots to keep in the Snapper\n     configuration (see\nSection 10.5.1, “Managing existing configurations”\nfor\n     details).\nnumber\nDeletes old snapshots when a certain snapshot count is reached.\ntimeline\nDeletes old snapshots having passed a certain age, but keeps several\n        hourly, daily, monthly, and yearly snapshots.\nempty-pre-post\nDeletes pre/post snapshot pairs with empty diffs.\n10.6.2\nCreating snapshots\n#\nTo create a snapshot, run\nsnapper create\nor\n    click\nCreate\nin the YaST module\nSnapper\n. The following examples explain how to create\n    snapshots from the command line.\n    The YaST interface for Snapper is not explicitly described here but\n    provides equivalent functionality.\nTip: Snapshot description\nAlways specify a meaningful description to later be able to\n     identify its purpose. You can also specify additional information via\n     the option\n--userdata\n.\nsnapper create --from\n17\n--description \n        \"with package2\"\nCreates a stand-alone snapshot (type single) from an existing snapshot, which is specified\n       by the snapshot's number from\nsnapper list\n. (This applies to Snapper version\n       0.8.4 and newer.)\nsnapper create --description \"Snapshot for week 2\n      2014\"\nCreates a stand-alone snapshot (type single) for the default\n       (\nroot\n) configuration with a description.

This option is only available when\n       using snapper on the command line.\n10.6.3\nModifying snapshot metadata\n#\nSnapper allows you to modify the description, the cleanup algorithm, and\n    the user data of a snapshot. All other metadata cannot be changed. The\n    following examples explain how to modify snapshots from the command line.\n    It should be easy to adopt them when using the YaST interface.\nTo modify a snapshot on the command line, you need to know its number. Use\nsnapper list\nto display all snapshots\n    and their numbers.\nThe YaST\nSnapper\nmodule already lists all snapshots.\n    Choose one from the list and click\nModify\n.\nsnapper modify --cleanup-algorithm \"timeline\"\n10\nModifies the metadata of snapshot 10 for the default\n       (\nroot\n) configuration. The cleanup algorithm is set to\ntimeline\n.\nsnapper --config home modify --description \"daily backup\"\n     -cleanup-algorithm \"timeline\" 120\nModifies the metadata of snapshot 120 for a custom configuration named\nhome\n. A new description is set and the cleanup\n       algorithm is unset.\n10.6.4\nDeleting snapshots\n#\nTo delete a snapshot with the YaST\nSnapper\nmodule,\n    choose a snapshot from the list and click\nDelete\n.\nTo delete a snapshot with the command-line tool, you need to know its\n    number. Get it by running\nsnapper list\n. To delete a\n    snapshot, run\nsnapper delete\nNUMBER\n.\nDeleting the current default subvolume snapshot is not allowed.\nWhen deleting snapshots with Snapper, the freed space will be claimed by a\n    Btrfs process running in the background. Thus the visibility and the\n    availability of free space is delayed. In case you need space freed by\n    deleting a snapshot to be available immediately, use the option\n--sync\nwith the delete command.\nTip: Deleting snapshot pairs\nWhen deleting a\npre\nsnapshot, you should always delete\n     its corresponding\npost\nsnapshot (and vice versa).\nsnapper delete 65\nDeletes snapshot 65 for the default (\nroot\n)\n       configuration.\nsnapper -c home delete 89 90\nDeletes snapshots 89 and 90 for a custom configuration named\nhome\n.\nsnapper delete --sync 23\nDeletes snapshot 23 for the default (\nroot\n)\n       configuration and makes the freed space available immediately.\nTip: Delete unreferenced snapshots\nSometimes the Btrfs snapshot is present but the XML file containing the\n     metadata for Snapper is missing. In this case the snapshot is not visible\n     for Snapper and needs to be deleted manually:\nbtrfs subvolume delete /.snapshots/\nSNAPSHOTNUMBER\n/snapshot\nrm -rf /.snapshots/SNAPSHOTNUMBER\nTip: Old snapshots occupy more disk space\nIf you delete snapshots to free space on your hard disk, make sure to\n     delete old snapshots first. The older a snapshot is, the more disk space\n     it occupies.\nSnapshots are also automatically deleted by a daily cron job. Refer to\nSection 10.6.1.2, “Cleanup algorithms”\nfor details.\n10.7\nAutomatic snapshot clean-up\n#\nSnapshots occupy disk space and over time the amount of disk space occupied\n   by the snapshots may become large. To prevent disks from running out of\n   space, Snapper offers algorithms to automatically delete old snapshots.\n   These algorithms differentiate between timeline snapshots and numbered\n   snapshots (administration plus installation snapshot pairs). You can specify\n   the number of snapshots to keep for each type.\nIn addition to that, you can optionally specify a disk space quota, defining\n   the maximum amount of disk space the snapshots may occupy. It is also\n   possible to automatically delete pre and post snapshots pairs that do not\n   differ.\nA clean-up algorithm is always bound to a single Snapper configuration, so\n    you need to configure algorithms for each configuration. To prevent certain\n    snapshots from being automatically deleted, refer to\nCan a snapshot be protected from deletion?\n.\nThe default setup (\nroot\n) is configured to do clean-up\n   for numbered snapshots and empty pre and post snapshot pairs. Quota support\n   is enabled—snapshots may not occupy more than 50% of the available\n   disk space of the root partition. Timeline snapshots are disabled by\n   default, therefore the timeline clean-up algorithm is also disabled.\n10.7.1\nCleaning up numbered snapshots\n#\nCleaning up numbered snapshots—administration plus installation\n    snapshot pairs—is controlled by the following parameters of a Snapper\n    configuration.\nNUMBER_CLEANUP\nEnables or disables clean-up of installation and admin snapshot pairs.\n       If enabled, snapshot pairs are deleted when the total snapshot count\n       exceeds a number specified with\nNUMBER_LIMIT\nand/or\nNUMBER_LIMIT_IMPORTANT\nand\nan\n       age specified with\nNUMBER_MIN_AGE\n. Valid values:\nyes\n(enable),\nno\n(disable).\nThe default value is\n\"yes\"\n.\nExample command to change or set:\n>\nsudo\nsnapper -c\nCONFIG\nset-config \"NUMBER_CLEANUP=no\"\nNUMBER_LIMIT\n/\nNUMBER_LIMIT_IMPORTANT\nDefines how many regular and/or important installation and\n       administration snapshot pairs to keep. Ignored if\nNUMBER_CLEANUP\nis set to\n\"no\"\n.\nThe default value is\n\"2-10\"\nfor\nNUMBER_LIMIT\nand\n\"4-10\"\nfor\nNUMBER_LIMIT_IMPORTANT\n. The cleaning\n       algorithms delete snapshots above the specified maximum value,\n       without taking the snapshot and file system space into\n       account. The algorithms also delete snapshots above the minimum\n       value until the limits for the snapshot and file system are\n       reached.\nExample command to change or set:\n>\nsudo\nsnapper -c\nCONFIG\nset-config \"NUMBER_LIMIT=10\"\nImportant: Ranged compared to constant values\nIn case quota support is enabled (see\nSection 10.7.5, “Adding disk quota support”\n) the limit needs\n        to be specified as a minimum-maximum range, for example\n2-10\n. If quota support is disabled, a constant\n        value, for example\n10\n, needs to be provided,\n        otherwise cleaning-up will fail with an error.\nNUMBER_MIN_AGE\nDefines the minimum age in seconds a snapshot must have before it can\n       automatically be deleted. Snapshots younger than the value specified\n       here will not be deleted, regardless of how many exist.\nThe default value is\n\"1800\"\n.\nExample command to change or set:\n>\nsudo\nsnapper -c\nCONFIG\nset-config \"NUMBER_MIN_AGE=864000\"\nNote: Limit and age\nNUMBER_LIMIT\n,\nNUMBER_LIMIT_IMPORTANT\nand\nNUMBER_MIN_AGE\nare always evaluated. Snapshots are\n     only deleted when\nall\nconditions are met.\nIf you always want to keep the number of snapshots defined with\nNUMBER_LIMIT*\nregardless of their age, set\nNUMBER_MIN_AGE\nto\n0\n.\nThe following example shows a configuration to keep the last 10 important\n     and regular snapshots regardless of age:\nNUMBER_CLEANUP=yes\nNUMBER_LIMIT_IMPORTANT=10\nNUMBER_LIMIT=10\nNUMBER_MIN_AGE=0\nOn the other hand, if you do not want to keep snapshots beyond a certain\n     age, set\nNUMBER_LIMIT*\nto\n0\nand\n     provide the age with\nNUMBER_MIN_AGE\n.\nThe following example shows a configuration to only keep snapshots younger\n     than ten days:\nNUMBER_CLEANUP=yes\nNUMBER_LIMIT_IMPORTANT=0\nNUMBER_LIMIT=0\nNUMBER_MIN_AGE=864000\n10.7.2\nCleaning up timeline snapshots\n#\nCleaning up timeline snapshots is controlled by the following\n    parameters of a Snapper configuration.\nTIMELINE_CLEANUP\nEnables or disables clean-up of timeline snapshots. If enabled,\n       snapshots are deleted when the total snapshot count exceeds a number\n       specified with\nTIMELINE_LIMIT_*\nand\nan age specified with\nTIMELINE_MIN_AGE\n. Valid values:\nyes\n,\nno\n.\nThe default value is\n\"yes\"\n.\nExample command to change or set:\n>\nsudo\nsnapper -c\nCONFIG\nset-config \"TIMELINE_CLEANUP=yes\"\nTIMELINE_LIMIT_DAILY\n,\nTIMELINE_LIMIT_HOURLY\n,\nTIMELINE_LIMIT_MONTHLY\n,\nTIMELINE_LIMIT_WEEKLY\n,\nTIMELINE_LIMIT_YEARLY\nNumber of snapshots to keep for hour, day, month, week, and year.\nThe default value for each entry is\n\"10\"\n, except for\nTIMELINE_LIMIT_WEEKLY\n, which is set to\n\"0\"\nby default.\nTIMELINE_MIN_AGE\nDefines the minimum age in seconds a snapshot must have before it can\n       automatically be deleted.\nThe default value is\n\"1800\"\n.\nExample 10.1:\nExample timeline configuration\n#\nTIMELINE_CLEANUP=\"yes\"\nTIMELINE_CREATE=\"yes\"\nTIMELINE_LIMIT_DAILY=\"7\"\nTIMELINE_LIMIT_HOURLY=\"24\"\nTIMELINE_LIMIT_MONTHLY=\"12\"\nTIMELINE_LIMIT_WEEKLY=\"4\"\nTIMELINE_LIMIT_YEARLY=\"2\"\nTIMELINE_MIN_AGE=\"1800\"\nThis example configuration enables hourly snapshots which are\n     automatically cleaned up.\nTIMELINE_MIN_AGE\nand\nTIMELINE_LIMIT_*\nare always both evaluated. In this\n     example, the minimum age of a snapshot before it can be deleted is set to\n     30 minutes (1800 seconds). Since we create hourly snapshots, this ensures\n     that only the latest snapshots are kept. If\nTIMELINE_LIMIT_DAILY\nis set to not zero, this means\n     that the first snapshot of the day is kept, too.\nSnapshots to be kept\n#\nHourly: The last 24 snapshots that have been made.\nDaily: The first daily snapshot that has been made is kept from the last\n       seven days.\nMonthly: The first snapshot made on the last day of the month is kept\n       for the last twelve months.\nWeekly: The first snapshot made on the last day of the week is kept from\n       the last four weeks.\nYearly: The first snapshot made on the last day of the year is kept for\n       the last two years.\n10.7.3\nCleaning up snapshot pairs that do not differ\n#\nAs explained in\nSection 10.1.2, “Types of snapshots”\n, whenever you run a\n    YaST module or execute Zypper, a pre snapshot is created on start-up and\n    a post snapshot is created when exiting. In case you have not made any\n    changes there will be no difference between the pre and post snapshots.\n    Such\n“\nempty\n”\nsnapshot pairs can be automatically be deleted by\n    setting the following parameters in a Snapper configuration:\nEMPTY_PRE_POST_CLEANUP\nIf set to\nyes\n, pre and post snapshot pairs that do\n       not differ will be deleted.\nThe default value is\n\"yes\"\n.\nEMPTY_PRE_POST_MIN_AGE\nDefines the minimum age in seconds a pre and post snapshot pair that\n       does not differ must have before it can automatically be deleted.\nThe default value is\n\"1800\"\n.\n10.7.4\nCleaning up manually created snapshots\n#\nSnapper does not offer custom clean-up algorithms for manually created\n    snapshots. However, you can assign the number or timeline clean-up\n    algorithm to a manually created snapshot. If you do so, the snapshot will\n    join the\n“\nclean-up queue\n”\nfor the algorithm you specified.\n    You can specify a clean-up algorithm when creating a snapshot, or by\n    modifying an existing snapshot:\nsnapper create --description \"Test\" --cleanup-algorithm number\nCreates a stand-alone snapshot (type single) for the default (root)\n       configuration and assigns the\nnumber\nclean-up\n       algorithm.\nsnapper modify --cleanup-algorithm \"timeline\" 25\nModifies the snapshot with the number 25 and assigns the clean-up\n       algorithm\ntimeline\n.\n10.7.5\nAdding disk quota support\n#\nIn addition to the number and/or timeline clean-up algorithms described\n    above, Snapper supports quotas. You can define what percentage of the\n    available space snapshots are allowed to occupy. This percentage value\n    always applies to the Btrfs subvolume defined in the respective Snapper\n    configuration.\nBtrfs quotas are applied to subvolumes, not to users. You may apply \n       disk space quotas to users and groups (for example, with the\nquota\ncommand) in addition to using Btrfs quotas.\nIf Snapper was enabled during the installation, quota support is\n    automatically enabled. In case you manually enable Snapper at a later point\n    in time, you can enable quota support by running\nsnapper\n    setup-quota\n. This requires a valid configuration (see\nSection 10.5, “Creating and modifying Snapper configurations”\nfor more information).\nQuota support is controlled by the following parameters of a Snapper\n    configuration.\nQGROUP\nThe Btrfs quota group used by Snapper. If not set, run\nsnapper\n       setup-quota\n. If already set, only change if you are familiar\n       with\nman 8 btrfs-qgroup\n. This value is set with\nsnapper setup-quota\nand should not be changed.\nSPACE_LIMIT\nLimit of space snapshots are allowed to use in fractions of 1 (100%).\n       Valid values range from 0 to 1 (0.1 = 10%, 0.2 = 20%, ...).\nThe following limitations and guidelines apply:\nQuotas are only activated in\naddition\nto an existing\n      number and/or timeline clean-up algorithm. If no clean-up algorithm is\n      active, quota restrictions are not applied.\nWith quota support enabled, Snapper will perform two clean-up runs if\n      required. The first run will apply the rules specified for number and\n      timeline snapshots. Only if the quota is exceeded after this run, the\n      quota-specific rules will be applied in a second run.\nEven if quota support is enabled, Snapper will always keep the number of\n      snapshots specified with the\nNUMBER_LIMIT*\nand\nTIMELINE_LIMIT*\nvalues, even if the quota will be\n      exceeded. It is therefore recommended to specify ranged values\n      (\nMIN\n-\nMAX\n)\n      for\nNUMBER_LIMIT*\nand\nTIMELINE_LIMIT*\nto ensure the quota can be applied.\nIf, for example,\nNUMBER_LIMIT=5-20\nis set, Snapper\n      will perform a first clean-up run and reduce the number of regular\n      numbered snapshots to 20. In case these 20 snapshots exceed the\n      quota, Snapper will delete the oldest ones in a second run until the\n      quota is met. A minimum of five snapshots will always be kept, regardless\n      of the amount of space they occupy.\n10.8\nShowing exclusive disk space used by snapshots\n#\nSnapshots share data, for efficient use of storage space, so using ordinary\n      commands like\ndu\nand\ndf\nwill not measure\n      used disk space accurately. When you want to free up disk space on Btrfs \n      with quotas enabled, you need to know how much exclusive disk space is \n      used by each snapshot, rather than shared space. Snapper 0.6 and up reports \n      the used disk space for each snapshot in the\nUsed Space\ncolumn:\n#\nsnapper --iso list\n  # | Type   | Pre # | Date                | User | Used Space | Cleanup | Description           | Userdata     \n----+--------+-------+---------------------+------+------------+---------+-----------------------+--------------\n 0  | single |       |                     | root |            |         | current               |              \n 1* | single |       | 2019-07-22 13:08:38 | root |  16.00 KiB |         | first root filesystem |              \n 2  | single |       | 2019-07-22 14:21:05 | root |  14.23 MiB | number  | after installation    | important=yes\n 3  | pre    |       | 2019-07-22 14:26:03 | root | 144.00 KiB | number  | zypp(zypper)          | important=no \n 4  | post   |     3 | 2019-07-22 14:26:04 | root | 112.00 KiB | number  |                       | important=no \n 5  | pre    |       | 2019-07-23 08:19:36 | root | 128.00 KiB | number  | zypp(zypper)          | important=no \n 6  | post   |     5 | 2019-07-23 08:19:43 | root |  80.00 KiB | number  |                       | important=no \n 7  | pre    |       | 2019-07-23 08:20:50 | root | 256.00 KiB | number  | yast sw_single        |              \n 8  | pre    |       | 2019-07-23 08:23:22 | root | 112.00 KiB | number  | zypp(ruby.ruby2.5)    | important=no \n 9  | post   |     8 | 2019-07-23 08:23:35 | root |  64.00 KiB | number  |                       | important=no \n10  | post   |     7 | 2019-07-23 08:24:05 | root |  16.00 KiB | number  |                       |\nThe\nbtrfs\ncommand provides another view of space used by \n    snapshots:\n#\nbtrfs qgroup show -p /\nqgroupid         rfer         excl parent  \n--------         ----         ---- ------  \n0/5          16.00KiB     16.00KiB ---     \n[...]    \n0/272         3.09GiB     14.23MiB 1/0     \n0/273         3.11GiB    144.00KiB 1/0     \n0/274         3.11GiB    112.00KiB 1/0     \n0/275         3.11GiB    128.00KiB 1/0     \n0/276         3.11GiB     80.00KiB 1/0     \n0/277         3.11GiB    256.00KiB 1/0     \n0/278         3.11GiB    112.00KiB 1/0     \n0/279         3.12GiB     64.00KiB 1/0     \n0/280         3.12GiB     16.00KiB 1/0     \n1/0           3.33GiB    222.95MiB ---\nThe\nqgroupid\ncolumn displays the identification number for\n    each subvolume, assigning a qgroup level/ID combination.\nThe\nrfer\ncolumn displays the total amount of data \n    referred to in the subvolume.\nThe\nexcl\ncolumn displays the exclusive data in each\n    subvolume.\nThe\nparent\ncolumn shows the parent qgroup of the subvolumes.\nThe final item,\n1/0\n, shows the totals for the parent \n    qgroup.

Manually deleting \n      these snapshots after they are no longer needed is recommended. See\nSection 10.6.4, “Deleting snapshots”\nfor details.\n10.9\nFrequently asked questions\n#\nQ:\nWhy does Snapper never show changes in\n/var/log\n,\n/tmp\nand other directories?\nFor some directories we decided to exclude them from snapshots. See\nSection 10.1.3, “Directories that are excluded from snapshots”\nfor a list and reasons. To exclude\n      a path from snapshots we create a subvolume for that path.\nQ:\nCan I boot a snapshot from the boot loader?\nYes—refer to\nSection 10.3, “System rollback by booting from snapshots”\nfor\n      details.\nQ:\nCan a snapshot be protected from deletion?\nCurrently Snapper does not offer means to prevent a snapshot from being\n      deleted manually. However, you can prevent snapshots from being\n      automatically deleted by clean-up algorithms. Manually created snapshots\n      (see\nSection 10.6.2, “Creating snapshots”\n) have no clean-up\n      algorithm assigned unless you specify one with\n--cleanup-algorithm\n. Automatically created snapshots\n      always either have the\nnumber\nor\ntimeline\nalgorithm assigned. To remove such an\n      assignment from one or more snapshots, proceed as follows:\nList all available snapshots:\n>\nsudo\nsnapper list -a\nMemorize the number of the snapshot(s) you want to prevent from being\n        deleted.\nRun the following command and replace the number placeholders with the\n        number(s) you memorized:\n>\nsudo\nsnapper modify --cleanup-algorithm \"\"\n#1\n#2\n#n\nCheck the result by running\nsnapper list -a\nagain.\n        The entry in the column\nCleanup\nshould now be empty\n        for the snapshots you modified.\nQ:\nWhere can I get more information on Snapper?\nSee the Snapper home page at\nhttp://snapper.io/\n.\nOn this page\n10.1\nDefault setup\n10.2\nUsing Snapper to undo changes\n10.3\nSystem rollback by booting from snapshots\n10.4\nEnabling Snapper in user home directories\n10.5\nCreating and modifying Snapper configurations\n10.6\nManually creating and managing snapshots\n10.7\nAutomatic snapshot clean-up\n10.8\nShowing exclusive disk space used by snapshots\n10.9\nFrequently asked questions\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

This maximizes system uptime and availability,\n  which is especially important for mission-critical systems.\nThe information provided in this document relates to the AMD64/Intel 64,\n  POWER, and IBM Z architectures.\n11.1\nAdvantages of Kernel Live Patching\n#\nKLP offers several benefits.\nKeeping a large number of servers automatically up to date is essential\n     for organizations obtaining or maintaining certain compliance\n     certifications. KLP can help achieve compliance, while reducing the\n     need for costly maintenance windows.\nCompanies that work with service-level agreement contracts must guarantee\n     a specific level of their system accessibility and uptime. Live patching\n     makes it possible to patch systems without incurring downtime.\nSince KLP is part of the standard system update mechanism, there is no\n     need for specialized training or introduction of complicated maintenance\n     routines.\n11.2\nKernel Live Patching overview\n#\nKernel live patches are delivered as packages with modified code that are\n   separate from the main kernel package. The live patches are cumulative, so\n   the latest patch contains all fixes from the previous ones for the kernel\n   package. Each kernel live package is tied to the exact kernel revision for\n   which it is issued. The live patch package version number increases with\n   every addition of fixes.\nNote: Live patches and the running kernel\nTo determine the kernel patching status, use the\nklp -v\n      patches\ncommand. The\nuname\ncommand's output\n      does not change for patched kernels.\nImportant: Live patches compared to kernel updates\nLive patches contain only critical fixes, and they do not replace regular\n    kernel updates that require a reboot. Consider live patches as temporary\n    measures that protect the kernel until a proper kernel update and a reboot\n    are performed.\nThe diagram below illustrates the overall relationship between live patches\n   and kernel updates. The list of CVEs and defect reports addressed by the\n   currently active live patch can be viewed using the\nklp -v\n   patches\ncommand.\nIt is possible to have multiple versions of the kernel package installed\n   along with their live patches. These packages do not conflict. You can\n   install updated kernel packages along with live patches for the running\n   kernel. In this case, you may be prompted to reboot the system. Users with\n   SLE Live Patching subscriptions are eligible for technical support as\n   long as there are live patch updates for the running kernel (see\nSection 11.5.1, “Checking expiration date of the live patch”\n).\nWith KLP activated, every kernel update comes with a live patch package.\n   This live patch does not contain any fixes and serves as a seed for future\n   live patches for the corresponding kernel. These empty seed patches are\n   called\ninitial patches\n.\n11.2.1\nKernel Live Patching scope\n#\nThe scope of SLE Live Patching includes fixes for SUSE Common\n    Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS; SUSE CVSS is based on the CVSS v3.0\n    system) level 7+ vulnerabilities and bug fixes related to system stability\n    or data corruption. However, it may not be technically feasible to create\n    live patches for all fixes that fall under the specified categories. SUSE\n    therefore reserves the right to skip fixes in situations where creating a\n    kernel live patch is not possible for technical reasons. Currently, over\n    95% of qualifying fixes are released as live patches. For more information\n    on CVSS (the base for the SUSE CVSS rating), see\nCommon Vulnerability Scoring\n    System SIG\n.\n11.2.2\nKernel Live Patching limitations\n#\nKLP involves replacing functions and gracefully handling replacement of\n    interdependent function sets. This is done by redirecting calls to old code\n    to updated code in a different memory location. Changes in data structures\n    make the situation more complicated, as the data remain in place and cannot\n    be extended or reinterpreted. While there are techniques that allow\n    indirect alteration of data structures, some fixes cannot be converted to\n    live patches. In this situation, a system restart is the only way to apply\n    the fixes.\n11.3\nActivating Kernel Live Patching using YaST\n#\nTo activate KLP on your system, you need to have active SLES and SLE\n   Live Patching subscriptions. Visit\nSUSE Customer Center\nto check the status of your\n   subscriptions and obtain a registration code for the SLE Live Patching\n   subscription.\nTo activate Kernel Live Patching on your system, follow these steps:\nRun the\nyast2 registration\ncommand and click\nSelect Extensions\n.\nSelect\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Live Patching 15\nin the\n     list of available extensions and click\nNext\n.\nConfirm the license terms and click\nNext\n.\nEnter your SLE Live Patching registration code and click\nNext\n.\nCheck the\nInstallation Summary\nand selected\nPatterns\n. The patterns\nLive\n     Patching\nand\nSLE Live Patching Lifecycle\n     Data\nshould be automatically selected for installation along\n     with additional packages to satisfy dependencies.\nClick\nAccept\nto complete the installation. This will\n     install the base Kernel Live Patching components on your system, the initial live patch,\n     and the required dependencies.\n11.4\nActivating Kernel Live Patching from the command line\n#\nTo activate Kernel Live Patching, you need to have active SLES and SLES Live Patching\n   subscriptions. Visit\nSUSE Customer Center\nto check the\n   status of your subscriptions and obtain a registration code for the SLES\n   Live Patching subscription.\nRun\nsudo SUSEConnect --list-extensions\n. Note the exact\n     activation command for SLES Live Patching. Example command output\n     (abbreviated):\n$ SUSEConnect --list-extensions\n...\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Live Patching\n15 SP4\nx86_64\nActivate with: SUSEConnect -p sle-module-live-patching/15.4/x86_64 \\\n  -r ADDITIONAL REGCODE\nActivate SLES Live Patching using the obtained command followed by\n-r\nLIVE_PATCHING_REGISTRATION_CODE\n, for\n     example:\nSUSEConnect -p sle-module-live-patching/15.4/x86_64 \\\n  -r\nLIVE_PATCHING_REGISTRATION_CODE\nInstall the required packages and dependencies using the command\nzypper install -t pattern lp_sles\nAt this point, the system has already been live-patched.\nHere is how the process works behind the scenes: When the\n   package installation system detects that there is an installed kernel that\n   can be live-patched, and that there is a live patch for it in the software\n   channel, the system selects the live patch for installation. The kernel then\n   receives the live patch fixes\nas part of the package\n   installation\n. The kernel gets live-patched even before the\n   product installation is complete.\n11.5\nPerforming Kernel Live Patching\n#\nKernel live patches are installed as part of regular system updates.\n   However, there are several things you should be aware of.\nThe kernel is live-patched if a\nkernel-livepatch-*\npackage has been installed for the running kernel. You can use the command\nzypper se --details kernel-livepatch-*\nto check what\n     kernel live patch packages are installed on your system.\nWhen the\nkernel-default\npackage is installed, the update\n     manager prompts you to reboot the system. To prevent this message from\n     appearing, you can filter out kernel updates from the patching operation.\n     This can be done by adding package locks with Zypper. SUSE Manager also makes\n     it possible to filter channel contents (see\nLive\n     Patching with SUSE Manager\n).\nYou can check patching status using the\nklp status\ncommand. To examine installed patches, run the\nklp -v\n     patches\ncommand.\nKeep in mind that while there may be multiple kernel packages installed on\n     the system, only one of them is running at any given time. Similarly,\n     there may be multiple live patch packages installed, but only one live\n     patch is loaded into the kernel.\nThe active live patch is included in the\ninitrd\n. This\n     means that in case of an unexpected reboot, the system comes up with the\n     live patch fixes applied, so there is no need to perform patching again.\n11.5.1\nChecking expiration date of the live patch\n#\nMake sure that the\nlifecycle-data-sle-module-live-patching\nis installed,\n    then run the\nzypper lifecycle\ncommand. You should see\n    expiration dates for live patches in the\nPackage end of support if\n    different from product\nsection of the output.\nEvery live patch receives updates for one year from the release of the\n    underlying kernel package. The\nMaintained\n    kernels, patch updates and lifecycle\npage allows you to check\n    expiration dates based on the running kernel version without installing the\n    product extension.\n11.6\nTroubleshooting Kernel Live Patching issues\n#\n11.6.1\nManual patch downgrade\n#\nIf you find the latest live patch problematic, you can downgrade the\n    currently installed live patch back to its previous version. We recommend\n    performing patch downgrade before the system starts exhibiting issues. Keep\n    in mind that a system with kernel warnings or kernel error traces in the\n    system log may not be suitable for the patch downgrade procedure. If you\n    are unsure whether the system meets the requirements for a patch downgrade,\n    contact SUSE Technical Support for help.\nProcedure 11.1:\nManual patch downgrade\n#\nIdentify the running live patch using the\nklp -v\n      patches\ncommand. You can see the currently running patch on the\n      line starting with\nRPM:\n. For example:\nRPM: kernel-livepatch-5_3_18-24_29-default-2-2.1.x86_64\nThe\n5_3_18-24_29-default\nin the example above denotes\n      the exact running kernel version.\nUse the command\nzypper search -s\n      kernel-livepatch-\nRUNNING_KERNEL_VERSION\n-default\nto search for previous versions of the patch. The command returns a list\n      of available package versions. Keep in mind that for every new live patch\n      package release, the version number increases by one. Make sure that you\n      choose the version number one release lower than the current one.\nInstall the desired version with the command\nzypper in\n      --oldpackage\n      kernel-livepatch-\nRUNNING_KERNEL_VERSION\n-default=\nDESIRED_VERSION\n.\nOn this page\n11.1\nAdvantages of Kernel Live Patching\n11.2\nKernel Live Patching overview\n11.3\nActivating Kernel Live Patching using YaST\n11.4\nActivating Kernel Live Patching from the command line\n11.5\nPerforming Kernel Live Patching\n11.6\nTroubleshooting Kernel Live Patching issues\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

Every time a security fix is available as a live patch, customer\n      services will be secured after applying the live patch without restarting\n      the processes.\nLive patching operations are performed using the\nulp\ntool that is part of\nlibpulp\n.\nlibpulp\nis a\n      framework that consists of the\nlibpulp.so\nlibrary and the\nulp\nbinary that makes libraries live\n      patchable and applies live patches.\nTip\nYou can run the\nulp\ncommand either as a normal user\n        or a privileged user via the\nsudo\nmechanism. The difference is that\n        running\nulp\nvia\nsudo\nlets you view information of\n        processes or patch processes that are running by\nroot\n.\nTip: Install\nlibpulp-load-default\nThe\nlibpulp-load-default\nautomates the requirements and manual steps mentioned in\nSection 12.1.1, “Prerequisites”\nand\nSection 12.1.3, “Using\nlibpulp\n”\n.\n        If you install the package, you can skip those sections.\n12.1.1\nPrerequisites\n#\nFor ULP to work, two requirements must be met.\nInstall the ULP on your system by running:\n>\nsudo\nzypper in libpulp0 libpulp-tools\nApplications with desired live patch support must be launched\n            preloading the\nlibpulp.so.0\nlibrary. See\nSection 12.1.3, “Using\nlibpulp\n”\nfor more details.\n12.1.2\nSupported libraries\n#\nCurrently, only\nglibc\nand\nopenssl\n(\nopenssl1_1\n)\n        are supported. Additional packages will be available after they are\n        prepared for live patching. To receive\nglibc\nand\nopenssl\nlive patches, install both\nglibc-livepatches\nand\nopenssl-1_1-livepatches\npackages:\n>\nzypper install glibc-livepatches openssl-1_1-livepatches\n12.1.3\nUsing\nlibpulp\n#\nTo enable live patching on an application, you need to preload the\nlibpulp.so.0\nlibrary when starting the\n        application:\n>\nLD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib64/libpulp.so.0\nAPPLICATION_CMD\n12.1.3.1\nChecking if a library is live patchable\n#\nTo check whether a library is live patchable, use the following\n          command:\n>\nulp livepatchable\nPATH_TO_LIBRARY\n12.1.3.2\nChecking if a\n.so\nfile is a live patch container\n#\nA shared object (\n.so\n) is a live patch container\n          if it contains the ULP patch description embedded into it. You can\n          verify it with the following command:\n>\nreadelf -S\nSHARED_OBJECT\n| grep .ulp\nIf the output shows that there are both\n.ulp\nand\n.ulp.rev\nsections in the shared object, then it is\n          a live patch container.\n12.1.3.3\nApplying live patches\n#\nLive patches are applied using the\nulp trigger\ncommand, for example:\n>\nulp trigger -p\nPID\nLIVEPATCH\n.so\nReplace\nPID\nwith the process ID of the running\n          process that uses the library to be patched and\nLIVEPATCH.so\nwith the actual live patch file. The\n          command returns one of the following status messages:\nSUCCESS\nThe live patching operation was successful.\nSKIPPED\nThe patch was skipped because it was not designed for any\n                library that is loaded in the process.\nERROR\nAn error occurred, and you can retrieve more information by\n                inspecting the\nlibpulp\ninternal\n                message buffer. See\nSection 12.1.3.6, “View internal message queue”\nfor more information.\nIt is also possible to apply multiple live patches by using\n          wildcards, for example:\n>\nulp trigger '*.so'\nThe command tries to apply every patch in the current folder to every\n          process that have the\nlibpulp\nlibrary\n          loaded. If the patch is not suitable for the process, it is\n          automatically skipped. In the end, the tool shows how many patches it\n          successfully applied to how many processes.\n12.1.3.4\nReverting live patches\n#\nYou can use the\nulp trigger\ncommand to revert live\n          patches. There are two ways to revert live patches. You can revert a\n          live patch by using the\n--revert\nswitch and passing\n          the live patch container:\n>\nulp trigger -p\nPID\n--revert\nLIVEPATCH\n.so\nAlternatively, it is possible to remove all patches associated with a\n          particular library, for example:\n>\nulp trigger -p\nPID\n--revert-all=\nLIBRARY\nIn the example,\nLIBRARY\nrefers to the\n          actual library, such as\nlibcrypto.so.1.1\n.\nThe latter approach can be useful when the source code of the\n          original live patch is not available. Or you want to remove a\n          specific old patch and apply a new one while the target application\n          is still running a secure code, for example:\n>\nulp trigger -p\nPID\n--revert-all=libcrypto.so.1.1 new_livepatch2.so\n12.1.3.5\nView applied patches\n#\nIt is possible to verify which applications have live patches applied\n          by running:\n>\nulp patches\nThe output shows which libraries are live patchable and patches\n          loaded in programs, as well which bugs the patch addresses:\nPID: 10636, name: test\n  Livepatchable libraries:\n    in /lib64/libc.so.6:\n      livepatch: libc_livepatch1.so\n        bug labels: jsc#SLE-0000\n    in /usr/lib64/libpulp.so.0:\nIt is also possible to see which functions are patched by the live\n          patch:\n>\nulp dump\nLIVEPATCH.so\n12.1.3.6\nView internal message queue\n#\nLog messages from\nlibpulp.so\nare stored in a\n          buffer inside the library and are not displayed unless requested by\n          the user. To show these messages, run:\n>\nulp messages -p\nPID\n12.2\nMore information\n#\nFurther information about\nlibpulp\nis available\n      in the project's\nGit\n      repository\n.\nOn this page\n12.1\nAbout user space live patching\n12.2\nMore information\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

It does not affect a running system \n    as no changes are activated until after the system is rebooted. As reboots\n    are disruptive, the admin must decide if a reboot is more expensive than\n    disturbing running services. If reboots are too expensive then do not use\n    transactional updates.\nTransactional updates are run daily by the\ntransactional-update\nscript. The script checks for\n    available updates. If there are any updates, it creates a new snapshot of\n    the root file system in the background, and then fetches updates from the\n    release channels. After the new snapshot is completely updated, it is\n    marked as active and will be the new default root file system after the next \n    reboot of the system. When\ntransactional-update\nis set to run\n    automatically (which is the default behavior) it also reboots the system.\n    Both the time that the update runs and the reboot maintenance window are \n    configurable.\nOnly packages that are part of the snapshot of the root file system can be\n    updated. If packages contain files that are not part of the snapshot, the\n    update could fail or break the system.\nRPMs that require a license to be accepted cannot be updated.\n13.1\nLimitations of technology preview\n#\nAs a technology preview, there are certain limitations in functionality. The\n   following packages will not work with\ntransactional-update\n:\nThe\nnginx\ndefault index.html page may not be available\ntomcat-webapps\nand\ntomcat-admin-webapps\nphpMyAdmin\nsca-appliance-*\nmpi-selector\nemacs\nworks except for Emacs games\nbind\nand\nbind-chrootenv\ndocbook*\nsblim-sfcb*\ntexlive*\niso_ent\nopenjade\nopensp\npcp\nplymouth\npostgresql-server-10\npulseaudio-gdm-hooks\nsmartmontools\nThe updater component of the system installer does not work with a read-only\n   file system as it has no support for transactional updates.\nFurther considerations:\nIn general it is a good idea to minimize the time between updating the\n     system and rebooting the machine.\nOnly one update can be applied at a time. Be sure to reboot after an\n     update, and before the next update is applied.\nupdate-alternatives\nshould not be run after a\n     transactional update until the machine has been rebooted.\nDo not create new system users or system groups after a transactional\n     update until after reboot. It is acceptable to create normal users and\n     groups (UID > 1000, GID > 1000).\nYaST is not yet aware of transactional updates. If a YaST module needs\n     to install additional packages, this will not work. Normal system\n     operations only modifying configuration files in\n/etc\nwill work.\nFor\nphp7-fastcgi\n, you must manually create a symbolic link,\n/srv/www/cgi-bin/php\n, that points to\n/usr/bin/php-cgi\n.\nntp\nis part of the Legacy Module for migration from\n     older SLES versions. It is not supported on a new\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\ninstallation, and has been replaced by\nchrony\n. If you\n     continue to use\nntp\n, a fresh installation is required\n     to work correctly with transactional updates.\nsblim-sfcb\n: The whole sblim ecosystem is incompatible\n     with transactional update.\nbtrfs-defrag\nfrom the\nbtrfsmaintenance\npackage does not work with a read-only\n     root file system.\nFor\nbtrfs-balance\n, the variable\nBTRFS_BALANCE_MOUNTPOINTS\nin\n/etc/sysconfig/btrfsmaintenance\nmust be changed from\n/\nto\n/.snapshots\n.\nFor\nbtrfs-scrub\n, the variable\nBTRFS_SCRUB_MOUNTPOINTS\nin\n/etc/sysconfig/btrfsmaintenance\nmust be changed from\n/\nto\n/.snapshots\n.\n13.2\nEnabling\ntransactional-update\n#\nYou must enable the Transactional Server Module during system installation,\n   and then select the Transactional Server System Role. Installing any package \n   from the Transactional Server Module later in a running system is NOT \n   supported and may break the system.\nNote that changing the subvolume layout of the root partition, or putting \n      sub-directories or subvolumes of the root partition on their own partitions \n      (except\n/home\n,\n/var\n,\n/srv\n, and\n/opt\n) is not supported, \n      and will most likely break the system.\n13.3\nManaging automatic updates\n#\nAutomatic updates are controlled by a\nsystemd.timer\nthat runs once per day. This applies all updates, and informs\nrebootmgrd\nthat the machine should be rebooted. You may\n      adjust the time when the update runs, see systemd.timer(5). To adjust the\n      maintenance window, which is when\nrebootmgrd\nreboots the\n      system, see rebootmgrd(8).\nYou can disable automatic transactional updates with this command:\n#\nsystemctl --now disable transactional-update.timer\n13.4\nThe\ntransactional-update\ncommand\n#\nThe\ntransactional-update\ncommand enables atomic installation \n   or removal of updates; updates are applied only\n   if all of them can be successfully installed.\ntransactional-update\ncreates a snapshot of your system\n   before the update is applied, and you can restore this snapshot. All changes become \n   active only after reboot.\n--continue\nThe\n--continue\noption is for making multiple changes to an\n         existing snapshot without rebooting.\nThe default\ntransactional-update\nbehavior \n         is to create a new snapshot from the current root file system. If you\n         forget something, such as installing a new package, you have to reboot\n         to apply your previous changes, run\ntransactional-update\nagain to install the forgotten package, and reboot again. You cannot run the\ntransactional-update\ncommand multiple times without rebooting\n         to add more changes to the snapshot, because that creates separate \n         independent snapshots that do not include changes from the previous snapshots.\nUse the\n--continue\noption to make as many changes as you\n         want without rebooting. A separate snapshot is made each time, and each\n         snapshot contains all the changes you made in the previous snapshots, plus your \n         new changes. Repeat this process as many times as you want, and when the final\n         snapshot includes everything you want reboot the system, and your final snapshot\n         becomes the new root file system.\nAnother useful feature of the\n--continue\noption is you may\n         select any existing snapshot as the base for your new snapshot. The following example\n         demonstrates running\ntransactional-update\nto install a new\n         package in a snapshot based on snapshot 13, and then running it again to install \n         another package:\n#\ntransactional-update pkg install\npackage_1\n#\ntransactional-update --continue 13 pkg install\npackage_2\nThe\n--continue [num]\noption calls\nsnapper create --from\n,\n        see\nSection 10.6.2, “Creating snapshots”\n.\ncleanup\nIf the current root file system is identical to the active root\n    file system (after a reboot, before\ntransactional-update\ncreates a new snapshot with updates), all old snapshots without a\n    cleanup algorithm get a cleanup algorithm set. This ensures that old \n    snapshots will be deleted by Snapper. (See the section about cleanup \n    algorithms in snapper(8).) This also removes all unreferenced (and thus \n    unused)\n/etc\noverlay directories in\n/var/lib/overlay\n:\n#\ntransactional-update cleanup\npkg in/install\nInstalls individual packages from the available channels using the\nzypper install\ncommand.

The snapshot is activated afterwards and becomes the new root\n      file system after reboot.\n#\ntransactional-update dup\npatch\nIf there are new updates available, a new snapshot is created and\nzypper patch\nupdates the snapshot.\n#\ntransactional-update patch\nrollback\nThis sets the default subvolume. On systems with a read-write file system\nsnapper rollback\nis called. On a read-only file system\n      and without any argument, the current system is set to a new default root\n      file system. If you specify a number, that snapshot is used as the\n      default root file system. On a read-only file system, it does not create\n      any additional snapshots.\n#\ntransactional-update rollback\nsnapshot_number\ngrub.cfg\nThis creates a new GRUB2 configuration. Sometimes it is necessary to\n      adjust the boot configuration, for example adding additional kernel\n      parameters. Edit\n/etc/default/grub\n, run\ntransactional-update grub.cfg\n, and then reboot to\n      activate the change. You must immediately reboot, or the new GRUB2\n      configuration will be overwritten with the default by the next\n      transactional-update.\n#\ntransactional-update grub.cfg\nreboot\nThis parameter triggers a reboot after the action is completed.\n#\ntransactional-update\ndup\nreboot\n--help\nThis prints a help screen with options and subcommands.\n#\ntransactional-update --help\n13.5\nTroubleshooting\n#\nIf the upgrade fails, run\nsupportconfig\nto collect log\n   data.

VNC is \n    platform-independent and accesses the remote machine from any operating \n    system. This chapter describes how to connect to a VNC server with the \n    desktop clients vncviewer and Remmina, and how to operate a VNC server.\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nsupports two different kinds of VNC sessions: One-time\n    sessions that\n“\nlive\n”\nas long as the VNC connection from the\n    client is kept up, and persistent sessions that\n“\nlive\n”\nuntil\n    they are explicitly terminated.\nA VNC server can offer both kinds of sessions simultaneously on different\n   ports, but an open session cannot be converted from one type to the other.\n14.1\nThe\nvncviewer\nclient\n#\nTo connect to a VNC service provided by a server, a client is needed. The\n   default in\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nis\nvncviewer\n, provided by the\ntigervnc\npackage.\n14.1.1\nConnecting using the vncviewer CLI\n#\nTo start your VNC viewer and initiate a session with the server, use the\n    command:\n>\nvncviewer jupiter.example.com:1\nInstead of the VNC display number you can also specify the port number with\n    two colons:\n>\nvncviewer jupiter.example.com::5901\nNote: Display and port number\nThe actual display or port number you specify in the VNC client must be\n     the same as the display or port number picked by the\nvncserver\ncommand on the target machine. See\nSection 14.4, “Configuring persistent VNC server sessions”\nfor further info.\n14.1.2\nConnecting using the vncviewer GUI\n#\nBy running\nvncviewer\nwithout specifying\n--listen\nor a host to connect to, it will show a window\n    to ask for connection details. Enter the host into the\nVNC\n    server\nfield like in\nSection 14.1.1, “Connecting using the vncviewer CLI”\nand click\nConnect\n.\nFigure 14.1:\nvncviewer\n#\n14.1.3\nNotification of unencrypted connections\n#\nThe VNC protocol supports different kinds of encrypted connections, not to\n    be confused with password authentication. If a connection does not use TLS,\n    the text\n“\n(Connection not encrypted!)\n”\ncan be seen in the\n    window title of the VNC viewer.\n14.2\nRemmina: the remote desktop client\n#\nRemmina is a modern and feature rich remote desktop client. It supports\n   several access methods, for example VNC, SSH, RDP, and Spice.\n14.2.1\nInstallation\n#\nTo use Remmina, verify whether the\nremmina\npackage is\n    installed on your system, and install it if not. Remember to install the\n    VNC plug-in for Remmina as well:\n#\nzypper in remmina remmina-plugin-vnc\n14.2.2\nMain window\n#\nRun Remmina by entering the\nremmina\ncommand.\nFigure 14.2:\nRemmina's main window\n#\nThe main application window shows the list of stored remote sessions. Here\n    you can add and save a new remote session, quick-start a new session\n    without saving it, start a previously saved session, or set Remmina's\n    global preferences.\n14.2.3\nAdding remote sessions\n#\nTo add and save a new remote session, click\nin the\n    top left of the main window. The\nRemote Desktop Preference\nwindow opens.\nFigure 14.3:\nRemote desktop preference\n#\nComplete the fields that specify your newly added remote session profile.\n    The most important are:\nName\nName of the profile. It will be listed in the main window.\nProtocol\nThe protocol to use when connecting to the remote session, for example\n       VNC.\nServer\nThe IP or DNS address and display number of the remote server.\nUser name, password\nCredentials to use for remote authentication. Leave empty for no\n       authentication.\nColor depth, quality\nSelect the best options according to your connection speed and quality.\nSelect the\nAdvanced\ntab to enter more specific settings.\nTip: Disable encryption\nIf the communication between the client and the remote server is not\n     encrypted, activate\nDisable encryption\n, otherwise the\n     connection fails.\nSelect the\nSSH\ntab for advanced SSH tunneling and\n    authentication options.\nConfirm with\nSave\n. Your new profile will be listed in\n    the main window.\n14.2.4\nStarting remote sessions\n#\nYou can either start a previously saved session, or quick-start a remote\n    session without saving the connection details.\n14.2.4.1\nQuick-starting remote sessions\n#\nTo start a remote session quickly without adding and saving connection\n     details, use the drop-down box and text box at the top of the main window.\nFigure 14.4:\nQuick-starting\n#\nSelect the communication protocol from the drop-down box, for example\n     'VNC', then enter the VNC server DNS or IP address followed by a colon and\n     a display number, and confirm with\nEnter\n.\n14.2.4.2\nOpening saved remote sessions\n#\nTo open a specific remote session, double-click it from the list of\n     sessions.\n14.2.4.3\nRemote sessions window\n#\nRemote sessions are opened in tabs of a separate window. Each tab hosts\n     one session. The toolbar on the left of the window helps you manage the\n     windows/sessions, such as toggle fullscreen mode, resize the window to\n     match the display size of the session, send specific keystrokes to the\n     session, take screenshots of the session, or set the image quality.\nFigure 14.5:\nRemmina viewing remote session\n#\n14.2.5\nEditing, copying, and deleting saved sessions\n#\nTo\nedit\na saved remote session, right-click its name\n    in Remmina's main window and select\nEdit\n. Refer to\nSection 14.2.3, “Adding remote sessions”\nfor the description of the relevant\n    fields.\nTo\ncopy\na saved remote session, right-click its name\n    in Remmina's main window and select\nCopy\n. In the\nRemote Desktop Preference\nwindow, change the name of the\n    profile, optionally adjust relevant options, and confirm with\nSave\n.\nTo\nDelete\na saved remote session, right-click its name\n    in Remmina's main window and select\nDelete\n. Confirm\n    with\nYes\nin the next dialog.\n14.2.6\nRunning remote sessions from the command line\n#\nIf you need to open a remote session from the command line or from a batch\n    file without first opening the main application window, use the following\n    syntax:\n>\nremmina -c\nprofile_name\n.remmina\nRemmina's profile files are stored in the\n.local/share/remmina/\ndirectory in your home\n    directory. To determine which profile file belongs to the session you want\n    to open, run Remmina, click the session name in the main window, and read\n    the path to the profile file in the window's status line at the bottom.\nFigure 14.6:\nReading path to the profile file\n#\nWhile Remmina is not running, you can rename the profile file to a more\n    reasonable file name, such as\nsle15.remmina\n. You can\n    even copy the profile file to your custom directory and run it using the\nremmina -c\ncommand from there.\n14.3\nConfiguring one-time sessions on the VNC server\n#\nA one-time session is initiated by the remote client. It starts a graphical\n   login screen on the server. This way you can choose the user which starts\n   the session and, if supported by the login manager, the desktop environment.\n   When you terminate the client connection to such a VNC session, all\n   applications started within that session will be terminated, too. One-time\n   VNC sessions cannot be shared, but it is possible to have multiple sessions\n   on a single host at the same time.\nProcedure 14.1:\nEnabling one-time VNC sessions\n#\nStart\nYaST\n›\nNetwork\n     Services\n›\nRemote Administration (VNC)\n.\nCheck\nAllow Remote Administration Without Session\n     Management\n.\nActivate\nEnable access using a web browser\nif you plan\n     to access the VNC session in a Web browser window.\nIf necessary, also check\nOpen Port in Firewall\n(for\n     example, when your network interface is configured to be in the External\n     Zone). If you have more than one network interface, restrict opening the\n     firewall ports to a specific interface via\nFirewall\n     Details\n.\nConfirm your settings with\nNext\n.\nIn case not all needed packages are available yet, you need to approve the\n     installation of missing packages.\nTip: Restart the display manager\nYaST makes changes to the display manager settings. You need to log out\n      of your current graphical session and restart the display manager for the\n      changes to take effect.\nFigure 14.7:\nRemote administration\n#\n14.3.1\nAvailable configurations\n#\nThe default configuration on\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nserves sessions with a\n    resolution of 1024x768 pixels at a color depth of 16-bit. The sessions are\n    available on ports\n5901\nfor\n“\nregular\n”\nVNC viewers (equivalent to VNC display\n1\n) and on port\n5801\nfor Web browsers.\nOther configurations can be made available on different\n    ports\n, see\nSection 14.3.3, “Configuring one-time VNC sessions”\n.\nVNC display numbers and X display numbers are independent in one-time\n    sessions. A VNC display number is manually assigned to every configuration\n    that the server supports (:1 in the example above). Whenever a VNC session\n    is initiated with one of the configurations, it automatically gets a free X\n    display number.\nBy default, both the VNC client and server try to communicate securely via a\n    self-signed SSL certificate, which is generated after installation. You can\n    either use the default one, or replace it with your own. When using the\n    self-signed certificate, you need to confirm its signature before the first\n    connection—both in the VNC viewer and the Web browser.\nTip\nSome VNC clients refuse to establish a secure connection via the default\n     self-signed certificate. For example, the Vinagre client verifies the\n     certification against the GnuTLS global trust store and fails if the\n     certificate is self-signed. In such a case, either use an encryption\n     method other than\nx509\n, or generate a properly signed\n     certificate for the VNC server and import it to the client's system trust\n     store.\n14.3.2\nInitiating a one-time VNC session\n#\nTo connect to a one-time VNC session, a VNC viewer must be installed, see\n    also\nSection 14.1, “The\nvncviewer\nclient”\n.  Alternatively use a\n    JavaScript-capable Web browser to view the VNC session by entering the\n    following URL:\nhttp://jupiter.example.com:5801\n14.3.3\nConfiguring one-time VNC sessions\n#\nYou can skip this section, if you do not need or want to modify the default\n    configuration.\nOne-time VNC sessions are started via the\nsystemd\nsocket\nxvnc.socket\n. By default it offers six\n    configuration blocks: three for VNC viewers (\nvnc1\nto\nvnc3\n), and three serving a JavaScript client\n    (\nvnchttpd1\nto\nvnchttpd3\n). By default\n    only\nvnc1\nand\nvnchttpd1\nare active.\nTo activate the VNC server socket at boot time, run the following command:\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl enable xvnc.socket\nTo start the socket immediately, run:\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl start xvnc.socket\nThe\nXvnc\nserver can be configured via the\nserver_args\noption. For a list of options, see\nXvnc --help\n.\nWhen adding custom configurations, make sure they are not using ports that\n    are already in use by other configurations, other services, or existing\n    persistent VNC sessions on the same host.\nActivate configuration changes by entering the following command:\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl reload xvnc.socket\nImportant: Firewall and VNC ports\nWhen activating Remote Administration as described in\nProcedure 14.1, “Enabling one-time VNC sessions”\n, the ports\n5801\nand\n5901\nare opened in the firewall.\n     If the network interface serving the VNC sessions is protected by a\n     firewall, you need to manually open the respective ports when activating\n     additional ports for VNC sessions. See\nChapter 23,\nMasquerading and firewalls\nfor instructions.\n14.4\nConfiguring persistent VNC server sessions\n#\nA persistent session can be accessed from multiple clients simultaneously.\n   This is ideal for demonstration purposes where one client has full access\n   and all other clients have view-only access. Another use case are training sessions\n   where the trainer might need access to the trainee's desktop.\nTip: Connecting to a persistent VNC session\nTo connect to a persistent VNC session, a VNC viewer must be installed.\n    Refer to\nSection 14.1, “The\nvncviewer\nclient”\nfor more details.  Alternatively\n    use a JavaScript-capable Web browser to view the VNC session by entering the\n    following URL:\nhttp://jupiter.example.com:5801\nThere are two types of persistent VNC sessions:\nVNC session initiated using\nvncserver\nVNC session initiated using\nvncmanager\n14.4.1\nVNC session initiated using\nvncserver\n#\nThis type of persistent VNC session is initiated on the server. The session\n    and all applications started in this session run regardless of client\n    connections until the session is terminated. Access to persistent sessions\n    is protected by two possible types of passwords:\na regular password that grants full access or\nan optional view-only password that grants a non-interactive (view-only)\n      access.\nA session can have multiple client connections of both kinds at once.\nProcedure 14.2:\nStarting a persistent VNC session using\nvncserver\n#\nOpen a shell and make sure you are logged in as the user that should own\n      the VNC session.\nIf the network interface serving the VNC sessions is protected by a\n      firewall, you need to manually open the port used by your session in the\n      firewall. If starting multiple sessions you may alternatively open a\n      range of ports. See\nChapter 23,\nMasquerading and firewalls\nfor details\n      on how to configure the firewall.\nvncserver\nuses the ports\n5901\nfor display\n:1\n,\n5902\nfor\n      display\n:2\n, and so on. For persistent sessions, the\n      VNC display and the X display usually have the same number.\nTo start a session with a resolution of 1024x768 pixel and with a color\n      depth of 16-bit, enter the following command:\nvncserver -alwaysshared -geometry 1024x768 -depth 16\nThe\nvncserver\ncommand picks an unused display number\n      when none is given and prints its choice. See\nman 1\n      vncserver\nfor more options.\nWhen running\nvncserver\nfor the first time, it asks for a\n    password for full access to the session. If needed, you can also provide a\n    password for view-only access to the session.\nThe password(s) you are providing here are also used for future sessions\n    started by the same user. They can be changed with the\nvncpasswd\ncommand.\nImportant: Security considerations\nMake sure to use strong passwords of significant length (eight or more\n     characters). Do not share these passwords.\nTo terminate the session shut down the desktop environment that runs inside\n    the VNC session from the VNC viewer as you would shut it down if it was a\n    regular local X session.\nIf you prefer to manually terminate a session, open a shell on the VNC\n    server and make sure you are logged in as the user that owns the VNC\n    session you want to terminate. Run the following command to terminate the\n    session that runs on display\n:1\n:\nvncserver\n    -kill :1\n14.4.1.1\nConfiguring persistent VNC sessions\n#\nPersistent VNC sessions can be configured by editing\n$HOME/.vnc/xstartup\n. By default this shell script\n     starts the same GUI/window manager it was started from. In\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nthis will either be GNOME or IceWM. If you want to start your session\n     with a window manager of your choice, set the variable\nWINDOWMANAGER\n:\nWINDOWMANAGER=gnome vncserver -geometry 1024x768\nWINDOWMANAGER=icewm vncserver -geometry 1024x768\nNote: One configuration for each user\nPersistent VNC sessions are configured in a single per-user\n      configuration. Multiple sessions started by the same user will all use\n      the same start-up and password files.\n14.4.2\nVNC session initiated using\nvncmanager\n#\nProcedure 14.3:\nEnabling persistent VNC sessions\n#\nStart\nYaST\n›\nNetwork\n      Services\n›\nRemote Administration (VNC)\n.\nActivate\nAllow Remote Administration With Session\n      Management\n.\nActivate\nEnable access using a web browser\nif you plan\n      to access the VNC session in a Web browser window.\nIf necessary, also check\nOpen Port in Firewall\n(for\n      example, when your network interface is configured to be in the External\n      Zone). If you have more than one network interface, restrict opening the\n      firewall ports to a specific interface via\nFirewall\n      Details\n.\nConfirm your settings with\nNext\n.\nIn case not all needed packages are available yet, you need to approve\n      the installation of missing packages.\nTip: Restart the display manager\nYaST makes changes to the display manager settings. You need to log\n       out of your current graphical session and restart the display manager\n       for the changes to take effect.\n14.4.2.1\nConfiguring persistent VNC sessions\n#\nAfter you enable the VNC session management as described in\nProcedure 14.3, “Enabling persistent VNC sessions”\n, you can normally connect to\n     the remote session with your favorite VNC viewer, such as\nvncviewer\nor Remmina. You will be presented with the\n     login screen. After you log in, the 'VNC' icon will appear in the system\n     tray of your desktop environment. Click the icon to open the\nVNC\n     Session\nwindow. If it does not appear or if your desktop\n     environment does not support icons in the system tray, run\nvncmanager-controller\nmanually.\nFigure 14.8:\nVNC session settings\n#\nThere are several settings that influence the VNC session's behavior:\nNon-persistent, private\nThis is equivalent to a one-time session. It is not visible to others\n        and will be terminated after you disconnect from it. Refer to\nSection 14.3, “Configuring one-time sessions on the VNC server”\nfor more information.\nPersistent, visible\nThe session is visible to other users and keeps running even after you\n        disconnect from it.\nSession name\nHere you can specify the name of the persistent session so that it is\n        easily identified when reconnecting.\nNo password required\nThe session will be freely accessible without having to log in under\n        user credentials.\nRequire user login\nYou need to log in with a valid user name and password to access the\n        session. Lists the valid user names in the\nAllowed\n        users\ntext box.\nAllow one client at a time\nPrevents multiple users from joining the session at the same time.\nAllow multiple clients at a time\nAllows multiple users to join the persistent session at the same time.\n        Useful for remote presentations or training sessions.\nConfirm with\nOK\n.\n14.4.2.2\nJoining persistent VNC sessions\n#\nAfter you set up a persistent VNC session as described in\nSection 14.4.2.1, “Configuring persistent VNC sessions”\n, you can join\n     it with your VNC viewer. After your VNC client connects to the server,\n     you will be prompted to choose whether you want to create a new session,\n     or join the existing one:\nFigure 14.9:\nJoining a persistent VNC session\n#\nAfter you click the name of the existing session, you may be asked for\n     login credentials, depending on the persistent session settings.\n14.5\nConfiguring encryption on the VNC server\n#\nIf the VNC server is set up properly, all communication between the VNC\n   server and the client is encrypted. The authentication happens at the\n   beginning of the session; the actual data transfer only begins afterward.\nWhether for a one-time or a persistent VNC session, security options are\n   configured via the\n-securitytypes\nparameter of the\n/usr/bin/Xvnc\ncommand located on the\nserver_args\nline. The\n-securitytypes\nparameter selects both authentication method and encryption. It has the\n   following options:\nAuthentications\n#\nNone, TLSNone, x509None\nNo authentication.\nVncAuth, TLSVnc, x509Vnc\nAuthentication using custom password.\nPlain, TLSPlain, x509Plain\nAuthentication using PAM to verify user's password.\nEncryptions\n#\nNone, vncAuth, plain\nNo encryption.\nTLSNone, TLSVnc, TLSPlain\nAnonymous TLS encryption. Everything is encrypted, but there is no\n      verification of the remote host. So you are protected against passive\n      attackers, but not against man-in-the-middle attackers.\nX509None, x509Vnc, x509Plain\nTLS encryption with certificate. If you use a self-signed certificate,\n      you will be asked to verify it on the first connection. On subsequent\n      connections you will be warned only if the certificate changed. So you\n      are protected against everything except man-in-the-middle on the first\n      connection (similar to typical SSH usage). If you use a certificate\n      signed by a certificate authority matching the machine name, then you get\n      full security (similar to typical HTTPS usage).\nTip\nSome VNC clients refuse to establish a secure connection via the default\n       self-signed certificate. For example, the Vinagre client verifies the\n       certification against the GnuTLS global trust store and fails if the\n       certificate is self-signed. In such a case, either use an encryption\n       method other than\nx509\n, or generate a properly signed\n       certificate for the VNC server and import it to the client's system trust\n       store.\nTip: Path to certificate and key\nWith X509 based encryption, you need to specify the path to the X509\n       certificate and the key with\n-X509Cert\nand\n-X509Key\noptions.\nIf you select multiple security types separated by comma, the first one\n   supported and allowed by both client and server will be used. That way you\n   can configure opportunistic encryption on the server. This is useful if you\n   need to support VNC clients that do not support encryption.\nOn the client, you can also specify the allowed security types to prevent a\n   downgrade attack if you are connecting to a server which you know has\n   encryption enabled (although our vncviewer will warn you with the\n   \"Connection not encrypted!\" message in that case).\n14.6\nCompatibility with Wayland\n#\nThe Remote Administration (VNC) feature relies on X11 and may result in an\n    empty screen if Wayland is enabled.\n\n    The display manager must be configured to use X11 instead of Wayland.\n\n    For\ngdm\n, edit\n/etc/gdm/custom.conf\n.\n    In the\n[daemon]\nsection, add\nWaylandEnable=false\nto the configuration file.\n\n    When logging in, the user must choose an X11-compatible session as well.\n\n    If you wish to remove the Wayland option for GNOME, you can remove and lock\n    the\ngnome-session-wayland\npackage.\nOn this page\n14.1\nThe\nvncviewer\nclient\n14.2\nRemmina: the remote desktop client\n14.3\nConfiguring one-time sessions on the VNC server\n14.4\nConfiguring persistent VNC server sessions\n14.5\nConfiguring encryption on the VNC server\n14.6\nCompatibility with Wayland\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

This makes the task of keeping files and\n    documents in synchronization across multiple devices all the more important.\nWarning: Risk of data loss\nBefore you start using a synchronization tool, you should familiarize\n   yourself with its features and functionality. Make sure to back up your\n   important files.\n15.1\nConceptual overview\n#\nFor synchronizing a large amount of data over a slow network connection,\n   Rsync offers a reliable method of transmitting only changes within files.\n   This applies not only to text files but also binary files. To detect the\n   differences between files, Rsync subdivides the files into blocks and\n   computes check sums over them.\nDetecting changes requires some computing power. So make sure that machines\n   on both ends have enough resources, including RAM.\nRsync can be particularly useful when large amounts of data containing only\n   minor changes need to be transmitted regularly. This is often the case when\n   working with backups. Rsync can also be useful for mirroring staging servers\n   that store complete directory trees of Web servers to a Web server in a DMZ.\nDespite its name, Rsync is not a synchronization tool. Rsync is a tool that\n   copies data only in one direction at a time. It does not and cannot do the\n   reverse. If you need a bidirectional tool which can synchronize both\n   source and destination, use Csync.\n15.2\nBasic syntax\n#\nRsync is a command-line tool that has the following basic syntax:\nrsync [OPTION] SOURCE [SOURCE]... DEST\nYou can use Rsync on any local or remote machine, provided you have access\n   and write permissions. It is possible to have multiple\nSOURCE\nentries. The\nSOURCE\nand\nDEST\nplaceholders can be paths, URLs, or both.\nBelow are the most common Rsync options:\n-v\nOutputs more verbose text\n-a\nArchive mode; copies files recursively and preserves time stamps,\n      user/group ownership, file permissions, and symbolic links\n-z\nCompresses the transmitted data\nNote: Trailing slashes count\nWhen working with Rsync, you should pay particular attention to trailing\n    slashes. A trailing slash after the directory denotes the\ncontent\nof the directory. No trailing slash denotes\n    the\ndirectory itself\n.\n15.3\nCopying files and directories locally\n#\nThe following description assumes that the current user has write\n   permissions to the directory\n/var/backup\n. To copy a\n   single file from one directory on your machine to another path, use the\n   following command:\n>\nrsync\n-avz backup.tar.xz /var/backup/\nThe file\nbackup.tar.xz\nis copied to\n/var/backup/\n; the absolute path will be\n/var/backup/backup.tar.xz\n.\nDo not forget to add the\ntrailing slash\nafter the\n/var/backup/\ndirectory! If you do not insert the slash,\n   the file\nbackup.tar.xz\nis copied to\n/var/backup\n(file)\nnot\ninside the\n   directory\n/var/backup/\n!\nCopying a directory is similar to copying a single file. The following\n   example copies the directory\ntux/\nand\n   its content into the directory\n/var/backup/\n:\n>\nrsync\n-avz tux /var/backup/\nFind the copy in the absolute path\n/var/backup/tux/\n.\n15.4\nCopying files and directories remotely\n#\nThe Rsync tool is required on both machines. To copy files from or to remote\n   directories requires an IP address or a domain name. A user name is optional\n   if your current user names on the local and remote machine are the same.\nTo copy the file\nfile.tar.xz\nfrom your local host to\n   the remote host\n192.168.1.1\nwith\n   same users (being local and remote), use the following command:\n>\nrsync\n-avz file.tar.xz  tux@192.168.1.1:\nDepending on what you prefer, these commands are also possible and\n   equivalent:\n>\nrsync\n-avz file.tar.xz 192.168.1.1:~\n>\nrsync\n-avz file.tar.xz 192.168.1.1:/home/tux\nIn all cases with standard configuration, you will be prompted to enter your\n   passphrase of the remote user. This command will copy\nfile.tar.xz\nto the home directory of user\ntux\n(usually\n/home/tux\n).\nCopying a directory remotely is similar to copying a directory locally. The\n   following example copies the directory\ntux/\nand its content into the remote\n   directory\n/var/backup/\non the\n192.168.1.1\nhost:\n>\nrsync\n-avz tux 192.168.1.1:/var/backup/\nAssuming you have write permissions on the host\n192.168.1.1\n, you will\n   find the copy in the absolute path\n/var/backup/tux\n.\n15.5\nConfiguring and using an rsync server\n#\nRsync can run as a daemon\n   (\nrsyncd\n) listening on default\n   port 873 for incoming connections. This daemon can receive\n“\ncopying\n   targets\n”\n.\nThe following description explains how to create an Rsync server on a\njupiter\nhost with a\nbackup\ntarget.  This target can be used to store your backups. To create an Rsync\n    server, do the following:\nProcedure 15.1:\nSetting up an rsync server\n#\nOn jupiter, create a directory to store all your backup files. In this\n     example, we use\n/var/backup\n:\n#\nmkdir\n/var/backup\nSpecify ownership. In this case, the directory is owned by user\ntux\nin group\nusers\n:\n#\nchown\ntux.users /var/backup\nConfigure the rsyncd daemon.\nWe will separate the configuration file into a main file and some\n“\nmodules\n”\nwhich hold your backup target. This makes it easier\n     to add additional targets later. Global values can be stored in\n/etc/rsyncd.d/*.inc\nfiles, whereas your modules are\n     placed in\n/etc/rsyncd.d/*.conf\nfiles:\nCreate a directory\n/etc/rsyncd.d/\n:\n#\nmkdir\n/etc/rsyncd.d/\nIn the main configuration file\n/etc/rsyncd.conf\n,\n       add the following lines:\n# rsyncd.conf main configuration file\nlog file = /var/log/rsync.log\npid file = /var/lock/rsync.lock\n\n&merge /etc/rsyncd.d\n1\n&include /etc/rsyncd.d\n2\n1\nMerges global values from\n/etc/rsyncd.d/*.inc\nfiles into the main configuration file.\n2\nLoads any modules (or targets) from\n/etc/rsyncd.d/*.conf\nfiles. These files should\n         not contain any references to global values.\nCreate your module (your backup target) in the file\n/etc/rsyncd.d/backup.conf\nwith the following lines:\n# backup.conf: backup module\n[backup]\n1\nuid = tux\n2\ngid = users\n2\npath = /var/backup\n3\nauth users = tux\n4\nsecrets file = /etc/rsyncd.secrets\n5\ncomment = Our backup target\n1\nThe\nbackup\ntarget. You can use any name you like.\n         However, it is a good idea to name a target according to its purpose\n         and use the same name in your\n*.conf\nfile.\n2\nSpecifies the user name or group name that is used when the file\n         transfer takes place.\n3\nDefines the path to store your backups (from\nStep 1\n).\n4\nSpecifies a comma-separated list of allowed users. In its simplest\n         form, it contains the user names that are allowed to connect to this\n         module. In our case, only user\ntux\nis allowed.\n5\nSpecifies the path of a file that contains lines with user names and\n         plain passwords.\nCreate the\n/etc/rsyncd.secrets\nfile with the\n       following content and replace\nPASSPHRASE\n:\n# user:passwd\ntux:\nPASSPHRASE\nMake sure the file is only readable by\nroot\n:\n#\nchmod\n0600 /etc/rsyncd.secrets\nStart and enable the rsyncd daemon with:\n#\nsystemctl\nenable rsyncd\n#\nsystemctl\nstart rsyncd\nTest the access to your Rsync server:\n>\nrsync\njupiter::\nYou should see a response that looks like this:\nbackup          Our backup target\nOtherwise, check your configuration file, firewall and network settings.\nThe above steps create an Rsync server that can now be used to store\n   backups. The example also creates a log file listing all connections. This\n   file is stored in\n/var/log/rsyncd.log\n. This is useful\n   if you want to debug your transfers.\nTo list the content of your backup target, use the following command:\n>\nrsync -avz jupiter::backup\nThis command lists all files present in the directory\n/var/backup\non the server. This request is also logged\n   in the log file\n/var/log/rsyncd.log\n. To start an actual\n   transfer, provide a source directory. Use\n.\nfor the\n   current directory. For example, the following command copies the current\n   directory to your Rsync backup server:\n>\nrsync -avz . jupiter::backup\nBy default, Rsync does not delete files and directories when it runs. To\n   enable deletion, the additional option\n--delete\nmust be\n   stated. To ensure that no newer files are deleted, the option\n--update\ncan be used instead. Any conflicts that arise must\n   be resolved manually.\n15.6\nMore information\n#\nCsync\nBidirectional file synchronization tool, see\nhttps://csync.org/\n.\nRSnapshot\nCreates incremental backups, see\nhttps://rsnapshot.org\n.\nUnison\nA file synchronization tool similar to CSync but with a graphical\n      interface, see\nhttps://github.com/bcpierce00/unison\n.\nRear\nA disaster recovery framework, see the\nAdministration\n      Guide\nof the SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability, chapter\nDisaster Recovery with Rear (Relax-and-Recover)\n.\nOn this page\n15.1\nConceptual overview\n15.2\nBasic syntax\n15.3\nCopying files and directories locally\n15.4\nCopying files and directories remotely\n15.5\nConfiguring and using an rsync server\n15.6\nMore information\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

After a\n    firmware and hardware initialization process, which depends on the\n    machine's architecture, the kernel is started by means of the boot loader\n    GRUB 2. After this point, the boot process is completely controlled by the\n    operating system and handled by\nsystemd\n.\nsystemd\nprovides a set of\n“\ntargets\n”\nthat boot configurations for everyday usage,\n    maintenance or emergencies.\n16.1\nTerminology\n#\nThis chapter uses terms that can be interpreted ambiguously. To\n   understand how they are used here, read the definitions below:\ninit\nTwo different processes are commonly named\n“\ninit\n”\n:\nThe\ninitramfs\nprocess mounting the root\n        file system\nThe operating system process that starts all other processes that is\n        executed from the real root file system\nIn both cases, the\nsystemd\nprogram is taking care of this task. It is\n      first executed from the\ninitramfs\nto mount the\n      root file system. When that has succeeded, it is re-executed from the\n      root file system as the initial process. To avoid confusing these two\nsystemd\nprocesses, we refer to the first process as\ninit on\n      initramfs\nand to the second one as\nsystemd\n.\ninitrd\n/\ninitramfs\nAn\ninitrd\n(initial RAM disk) is an image file\n      containing a root file system image which is loaded by the kernel and\n      mounted from\n/dev/ram\nas the temporary root file\n      system. Mounting this file system requires a file system driver.\nBeginning with kernel 2.6.13, the initrd has been replaced by the\ninitramfs\n(initial RAM file system), which does\n      not require a file system driver to be mounted.\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nexclusively\n      uses an\ninitramfs\n. However, since the\ninitramfs\nis stored as\n/boot/initrd\n, it is often called\n“\ninitrd\n”\n. In this chapter we exclusively use the name\ninitramfs\n.\n16.2\nThe Linux boot process\n#\nThe Linux boot process consists of several stages, each represented by a\n   different component:\nSection 16.2.1, “The initialization and boot loader phase”\nSection 16.2.2, “The kernel phase”\nSection 16.2.3, “The init on initramfs phase”\nSection 16.2.4, “The systemd phase”\n16.2.1\nThe initialization and boot loader phase\n#\nDuring the initialization phase the machine's hardware is set up and the\n    devices are prepared. This process differs significantly between hardware\n    architectures.\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nuses the boot loader GRUB 2 on all architectures. Depending\n    on the architecture and firmware, starting the GRUB 2 boot loader can be a\n    multi-step process. The purpose of the boot loader is to load the kernel\n    and the initial, RAM-based file system (initramfs). For more information\n    about GRUB 2, refer to\nChapter 18,\nThe boot loader GRUB 2\n.\n16.2.1.1\nInitialization and boot loader phase on AArch64 and AMD64/Intel 64\n#\nAfter turning on the computer, the BIOS or the UEFI initializes the screen\n     and keyboard, and tests the main memory. Up to this stage, the machine\n     does not access any mass storage media. Subsequently, the information\n     about the current date, time, and the most important peripherals are\n     loaded from the CMOS values. When the boot media and its geometry are\n     recognized, the system control passes from the BIOS/UEFI to the boot\n     loader.\nOn a machine equipped with a traditional BIOS, only code from the first\n     physical 512-byte data sector (the Master Boot Record, MBR) of the boot\n     disk can be loaded. Only a minimal GRUB 2 fits into the MBR. Its sole\n     purpose is to load a GRUB 2 core image containing file system drivers from\n     the gap between the MBR and the first partition (MBR partition table) or\n     from the BIOS boot partition (GPT partition table). This image contains\n     file system drivers and therefore is able to access\n/boot\nlocated on the root file\n     system.\n/boot\ncontains additional modules for GRUB 2\n     core as well as the kernel and the initramfs image. When it has access to\n     this partition, GRUB 2 loads the kernel and the initramfs image into\n     memory and hands control over to the kernel.\nWhen booting a BIOS system from an encrypted file system that includes an\n     encrypted\n/boot\npartition, you need to enter the\n     password for decryption twice. It is first needed by GRUB 2 to decrypt\n/boot\nand then for\nsystemd\nto mount the encrypted\n     volumes.\nOn machines with UEFI the boot process is much simpler than on machines\n     with a traditional BIOS. The firmware is able to read from a FAT formatted\n     system partition of disks with a GPT partition table. This EFI\n     system-partition (in the running system mounted as\n/boot/efi\n) holds enough space to host a fully-fledged\n     GRUB 2 which is directly loaded and executed by the firmware.\nIf the BIOS/UEFI supports network booting, it is also possible to\n     configure a boot server that provides the boot loader. The system can then\n     be booted via PXE. The BIOS/UEFI acts as the boot loader. It gets the boot\n     image from the boot server and starts the system. This is completely\n     independent of local hard disks.\n16.2.1.2\nInitialization and boot loader phase on IBM Z\n#\nOn IBM Z the boot process must be initialized by a boot loader\n     called\nzipl\n(z initial program load). Although\nzipl\nsupports reading from various file systems, it\n     does not support the SLE default file system (Btrfs) or booting from\n     snapshots.\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\ntherefore uses a two-stage boot process that\n     ensures full Btrfs support at boot-time:\nzipl\nboots from the partition\n/boot/zipl\n, which can be formatted with the Ext2,\n       Ext3, Ext4, or XFS file system. This partition contains a minimal kernel\n       and an initramfs that are loaded into memory. The initramfs contains a\n       Btrfs driver (among others) and the boot loader GRUB 2. The kernel is\n       started with a parameter\ninitgrub\n, which tells it to\n       start GRUB 2.\nThe kernel mounts the root file system, so\n/boot\nbecomes accessible. Now GRUB 2 is started from the initramfs. It reads\n       its configuration from\n/boot/grub2/grub.cfg\nand\n       loads the final kernel and initramfs from\n/boot\n. The new kernel now gets loaded via Kexec.\n16.2.2\nThe kernel phase\n#\nWhen the boot loader has passed on system control, the boot process is the\n    same on all architectures. The boot loader loads both the kernel and an\n    initial RAM-based file system (\ninitramfs\n) into\n    memory and the kernel takes over.\nAfter the kernel has set up memory management and has detected the CPU type\n    and its features, it initializes the hardware and mounts the temporary root\n    file system from the memory that was loaded with the\ninitramfs\n.\n16.2.2.1\nThe\ninitramfs\nfile\n#\ninitramfs\n(initial RAM file system) is a small\n     cpio archive that the kernel can load into a RAM disk. It is located at\n/boot/initrd\n. It can be created with a tool called\ndracut\n—refer to\nman 8 dracut\nfor details.\nThe\ninitramfs\nprovides a minimal Linux\n     environment that enables the execution of programs before the actual root\n     file system is mounted. This minimal Linux environment is loaded into\n     memory by BIOS or UEFI routines and does not have specific hardware\n     requirements other than sufficient memory. The\ninitramfs\narchive must always provide an\n     executable named\ninit\nthat executes the\nsystemd\ndaemon on the root file system for the boot process to proceed.\nBefore the root file system can be mounted and the operating system can be\n     started, the kernel needs the corresponding drivers to access the device\n     on which the root file system is located. These drivers may include\n     special drivers for certain kinds of hard disks or even network drivers to\n     access a network file system. The needed modules for the root file system\n     are loaded by\ninit\non\ninitramfs\n. After the modules are loaded,\nudev\nprovides the\ninitramfs\nwith the needed devices. Later in the\n     boot process, after changing the root file system, it is necessary to\n     regenerate the devices. This is done by the\nsystemd\nunit\nsystemd-udev-trigger.service\n.\n16.2.2.1.1\nRegenerating the initramfs\n#\nBecause the\ninitramfs\ncontains drivers, it needs\n      to be updated whenever a new version of one of its drivers is\n      available. This is done automatically when installing the package\n      containing the driver update. YaST or zypper will inform you about\n      this by showing the output of the command that generates the\ninitramfs\n. However, there are some occasions\n      when you need to regenerate an\ninitramfs\nmanually:\nAdding drivers because of hardware changes\nIf you need to change hardware, for example, hard disks, and this\n         hardware requires different drivers to be in the kernel at boot time,\n         you must update the\ninitramfs\nfile.\nOpen or create\n/etc/dracut.conf.d/10-\nDRIVER\n.conf\nand add the following line (mind the leading blank space):\nforce_drivers+=\"\nDRIVER1\n\"\nReplace\nDRIVER1\nwith the module name of the\n         driver. If you need to add more than one driver, list them\n         space-separated:\nforce_drivers+=\"\nDRIVER1\nDRIVER2\n\"\nProceed with\nProcedure 16.1, “Generate an initramfs”\n.\nMoving system directories to a RAID or LVM\nWhenever you move swap files, or system directories like\n/usr\nin a running system to a RAID or logical\n         volume, you need to create an\ninitramfs\nthat\n         contains support for software RAID or LVM drivers.\nTo do so, create the respective entries in\n/etc/fstab\nand mount the new entries (for example\n         with\nmount -a\nand/or\nswapon -a\n).\nProceed with\nProcedure 16.1, “Generate an initramfs”\n.\nAdding disks to an LVM group or Btrfs RAID containing the root\n        file system\nWhenever you add (or remove) a disk to a logical volume group\n         or a Btrfs RAID containing the root file system, you need to create an\ninitramfs\nthat contains support for the\n         enlarged volume. Follow the instructions at\nProcedure 16.1, “Generate an initramfs”\n.\nProceed with\nProcedure 16.1, “Generate an initramfs”\n.\nChanging kernel variables\nIf you change the values of kernel variables via the\nsysctl\ninterface by editing related files\n         (\n/etc/sysctl.conf\nor\n/etc/sysctl.d/*.conf\n), the change will be lost on\n         the next system reboot. Even if you load the values with\nsysctl\n         --system\nat runtime, the changes are not saved into the\ninitramfs\nfile. You need to update it by\n         proceeding as outlined in\nProcedure 16.1, “Generate an initramfs”\n.\nAdding or removing swap devices, re-creating swap area\nWhenever you add or remove a swap device, or re-create a swap area\n              with a different UUID, update the initramfs as\n              outlined in\nProcedure 16.1, “Generate an initramfs”\n. You may also\n              need to update\nGRUB_CMDLINE_*\nvariables that\n              include the\nresume=\noption in\n/etc/default/grub\n, and then regenerate\n/boot/grub2/grub.cfg\nas outlined in\nSection 18.2.1, “The file\n/boot/grub2/grub.cfg\n”\n.\nProcedure 16.1:\nGenerate an initramfs\n#\nNote that all commands in the following procedure need to be executed \n       as the\nroot\nuser.\nEnter your\n/boot\ndirectory:\n#\ncd /boot\nGenerate a new\ninitramfs\nfile with\ndracut\n, replacing\nMY_INITRAMFS\nwith a file name of\n        your choice:\n#\ndracut\nMY_INITRAMFS\nAlternatively, run\ndracut -f\nFILENAME\nto replace an existing init file.\n(Skip this step if you ran\ndracut -f\nin the previous\n        step.) Create a symbolic link from the\ninitramfs\nfile you created in the previous step to\ninitrd\n:\n#\nln -sf\nMY_INITRAMFS\ninitrd\nOn the IBM Z architecture, additionally run\ngrub2-install\n.\n16.2.3\nThe init on initramfs phase\n#\nThe temporary root file system mounted by the kernel from the\ninitramfs\ncontains the executable\nsystemd\n(which\n    is called\ninit\non\ninitramfs\nin the following, also see\nSection 16.1, “Terminology”\n. This program performs all actions needed\n    to mount the proper root file system. It provides kernel functionality for\n    the needed file system and device drivers for mass storage controllers with\nudev\n.\nThe main purpose of\ninit\non\ninitramfs\nis to prepare the mounting of and access\n    to the real root file system. Depending on your system configuration,\ninit\non\ninitramfs\nis\n    responsible for the following tasks.\nLoading kernel modules\nDepending on your hardware configuration, special drivers may be needed\n       to access the hardware components of your computer (the most important\n       component being your hard disk). To access the final root file system,\n       the kernel needs to load the proper file system drivers.\nProviding block special files\nThe kernel generates device events depending on loaded modules.\nudev\nhandles these events and\n       generates the required special block files on a RAM file system in\n/dev\n. Without those special files, the file system\n       and other devices would not be accessible.\nManaging RAID and LVM setups\nIf you configured your system to hold the root file system under RAID or\n       LVM,\ninit\non\ninitramfs\nsets up LVM or RAID to enable access to the root file system later.\nManaging the network configuration\nIf you configured your system to use a network-mounted root file system\n       (mounted via NFS),\ninit\nmust make sure that the\n       proper network drivers are loaded and that they are set up to allow\n       access to the root file system.\nIf the file system resides on a network block device like iSCSI or SAN,\n       the connection to the storage server is also set up by\ninit\non\ninitramfs\n.\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nsupports booting from a secondary iSCSI target if the\n       primary target is not available.\nFor more details\n       regarding configuration of the booting iSCSI target refer to\nSection 15.3.1, “Using YaST for the iSCSI initiator configuration”\n.\nNote: Handling of mount failures\nIf the root file system fails to mount from within the boot environment,\n     it must be checked and repaired before the boot can continue. The file\n     system checker will be automatically started for Ext3 and Ext4 file\n     systems. The repair process is not automated for XFS and Btrfs file\n     systems, and the user is presented with information describing the\n     options available to repair the file system. When the file system has been\n     successfully repaired, exiting the boot environment will cause the system\n     to retry mounting the root file system. If successful, the boot will\n     continue normally.\n16.2.3.1\nThe init on initramfs phase in the installation process\n#\nWhen\ninit\non\ninitramfs\nis called during the initial boot as part of the installation process, its\n     tasks differ from those mentioned above. Note that the installation system\n     also does not start\nsystemd\nfrom\ninitramfs\n—these tasks are performed by\nlinuxrc\n.\nFinding the installation medium\nWhen starting the installation process, your machine loads an\n        installation kernel and a special\ninit\ncontaining the YaST installer. The YaST installer is running in a\n        RAM file system and needs to have information about the location of the\n        installation medium to access it for installing the operating system.\nInitiating hardware recognition and loading appropriate kernel modules\nAs mentioned in\nSection 16.2.2.1, “The\ninitramfs\nfile”\n, the boot process\n        starts with a minimum set of drivers that can be used with most\n        hardware configurations. On AArch64, POWER, and AMD64/Intel 64 machines,\nlinuxrc\nstarts an initial hardware scanning process\n        that determines the set of drivers suitable for your hardware\n        configuration. On IBM Z, a list of drivers and their parameters\n        needs to be provided, for example via linuxrc or a parmfile.\nThese drivers are used to generate a custom\ninitramfs\nthat is needed to boot the\n        system. If the modules are not needed for boot but for coldplug, the\n        modules can be loaded with\nsystemd\n; for more information, see\nSection 19.6.4, “Loading kernel modules”\n.\nLoading the installation system\nWhen the hardware is properly recognized, the appropriate drivers are\n        loaded. The\nudev\nprogram\n        creates the special device files and\nlinuxrc\nstarts the installation system with the YaST installer.\nStarting YaST\nFinally,\nlinuxrc\nstarts YaST, which starts\n        the package installation and the system configuration.\n16.2.4\nThe systemd phase\n#\nAfter the\n“\nreal\n”\nroot file system has been found, it is\n    checked for errors and mounted. If this is successful, the\ninitramfs\nis cleaned and the\nsystemd\ndaemon on\n    the root file system is executed.\nsystemd\nis Linux's system and service\n    manager. It is the parent process that is started as PID 1 and acts as an\n    init system which brings up and maintains user space services. See\nChapter 19,\nThe\nsystemd\ndaemon\nfor details.\nOn this page\n16.1\nTerminology\n16.2\nThe Linux boot process\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

UEFI, for example, properly supports 64-bit systems\n  and offers secure booting (\n“\nSecure Boot\n”\n, firmware version\n  2.3.1c or better required), which is one of its most important features.\n  Lastly, with UEFI a standard firmware will become available on all x86\n  platforms.\nUEFI additionally offers the following advantages:\nBooting from large disks (over 2 TiB) with a GUID Partition Table (GPT).\nCPU-independent architecture and drivers.\nFlexible pre-OS environment with network capabilities.\nCSM (Compatibility Support Module) to support booting legacy operating\n    systems via a PC-BIOS-like emulation.\nFor more information, see\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface\n.\n  The following sections are not meant as a general UEFI overview; these are\n  only hints about how some features are implemented in\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n.\n17.1\nSecure boot\n#\nIn the world of UEFI, securing the bootstrapping process means establishing\n   a chain of trust. The\n“\nplatform\n”\nis the root of this chain of\n   trust; in the context of\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n, the mainboard and the on-board firmware\n   could be considered the\n“\nplatform\n”\n. In other words, it is the hardware vendor, and the chain of trust flows from\n   that hardware vendor to the component manufacturers, the OS vendors, etc.\nThe trust is expressed via public key cryptography. The hardware vendor puts\n   a so-called Platform Key (PK) into the firmware, representing the root of\n   trust. The trust relationship with operating system vendors and others is\n   documented by signing their keys with the Platform Key.\nFinally, security is established by requiring that no code will be executed\n   by the firmware unless it has been signed by one of these\n“\ntrusted\n”\nkeys—be it an OS boot loader, some driver\n   located in the flash memory of some PCI Express card or on disk, or be it an\n   update of the firmware itself.\nTo use Secure Boot, you need to have your OS loader signed with\n   a key trusted by the firmware, and you need the OS loader to verify that the\n   kernel it loads can be trusted.\nKey Exchange Keys (KEK) can be added to the UEFI key database. This way, you\n   can use other certificates, as long as they are signed with the private part\n   of the PK.\n17.1.1\nImplementation on\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n#\nMicrosoft’s Key Exchange Key (KEK) is installed by default.\nNote: GUID partitioning table (GPT) required\nThe Secure Boot feature is enabled by default on UEFI/x86_64\n     installations. You can find the\nEnable Secure Boot\n     Support\noption in the\nBoot Code Options\ntab\n     of the\nBoot Loader Settings\ndialog. It supports booting\n     when the secure boot is activated in the firmware, while making it\n     possible to boot when it is deactivated.\nFigure 17.1:\nSecure boot support\n#\nThe Secure Boot feature requires that a GUID Partitioning Table (GPT)\n     replaces the old partitioning with a Master Boot Record (MBR). If YaST\n     detects EFI mode during the installation, it will try to create a GPT\n     partition. UEFI expects to find the EFI programs on a FAT-formatted EFI\n     System Partition (ESP).\nSupporting UEFI Secure Boot requires having a boot loader with\n    a digital signature that the firmware recognizes as a trusted key. That key\n    is trusted by the firmware a priori, without requiring any manual\n    intervention.\nThere are two ways of getting there. One is to work with hardware vendors\n    to have them endorse a SUSE key, which SUSE then signs the boot loader\n    with. The other way is to go through Microsoft’s Windows Logo\n    Certification program to have the boot loader certified and have Microsoft\n    recognize the SUSE signing key (that is, have it signed with their KEK). By\n    now, SUSE got the loader signed by UEFI Signing Service (that is Microsoft\n    in this case).\nFigure 17.2:\nUEFI: secure boot process\n#\nAt the implementation layer, SUSE uses the\nshim\nloader which is installed by default. It is a smart solution that avoids\n    legal issues, and simplifies the certification and signing step\n    considerably. The\nshim\nloader’s job is to load a\n    boot loader such as GRUB 2 and verify it; this boot loader in\n    turn will load kernels signed by a SUSE key only.\nSUSE provides this\n    functionality since SLE11 SP3 on fresh installations with UEFI Secure Boot\n    enabled.\nThere are two types of trusted users:\nFirst, those who hold the keys. The Platform Key (PK) allows almost\n      everything. The Key Exchange Key (KEK) allows all a PK can except\n      changing the PK.\nSecond, anyone with physical access to the machine. A user with physical\n      access can reboot the machine, and configure UEFI.\nUEFI offers two types of variables to fulfill the needs of those users:\nThe first is the so-called\n“\nAuthenticated Variables\n”\n, which\n      can be updated from both within the boot process (the so-called Boot\n      Services Environment) and the running OS. This can be done only when the new value of\n      the variable is signed with the same key that the old value of the\n      variable was signed with. And they can only be appended to or changed to\n      a value with a higher serial number.\nThe second is the so-called\n“\nBoot Services Only Variables\n”\n.\n      These variables are accessible to any code that runs during the boot\n      process. After the boot process ends and before the OS starts, the boot\n      loader must call the\nExitBootServices\ncall. After\n      that, these variables are no longer accessible, and the OS cannot touch\n      them.\nThe various UEFI key lists are of the first type, as this allows online\n    updating, adding, and blacklisting of keys, drivers, and firmware\n    fingerprints. It is the second type of variable, the\n“\nBoot Services\n    Only Variable\n”\n, that helps to implement Secure Boot in a secure and\n    open source-friendly manner, and thus compatible with\n    GPLv3.\nSUSE starts with\nshim\n—a small and simple EFI\n    boot loader signed by SUSE and Microsoft.\nThis allows\nshim\nto load and execute.\nshim\nthen goes on to verify that the boot loader\n    it wants to load is trusted.\n\n    In a default situation\nshim\nwill use an\n    independent SUSE certificate embedded in its body. In addition,\nshim\nwill allow to\n“\nenroll\n”\nadditional keys, overriding the default SUSE key. In the following, we call\n    them\n“\nMachine Owner Keys\n”\nor MOKs for short.\nNext the boot loader will verify and then boot the kernel, and the kernel\n    will do the same on the modules.\n17.1.2\nMOK (Machine Owner Key)\n#\nTo replace specific kernels, drivers, or other components that are part of\n   the boot process, you need to use Machine Owner Keys (MOKs). The\nmokutil\ntool can help you to manage MOKs.\nYou can create a MOK enrollment request with\nmokutil\n. The request is stored in a UEFI runtime\n   (RT) variable called\nMokNew\n. During the next boot,\n   the\nshim\nboot loader detects\nMokNew\nand loads\nMokManager\n, which presents you with several options.\n   You can use the\nEnroll key from disk\nand\nEnroll hash from disk\noptions to add the key to the\n   MokList. Use the\nEnroll MOK\noption to copy the key from\n   the\nMokNew\nvariable.\nEnrolling a key from disk is usually done when the shim fails to\n   load\ngrub2\nand falls back to loading\n   MokManager. As\nMokNew\ndoes not exist yet,\n   you have the option of locating the key on the UEFI partition.\n17.1.3\nBooting a custom kernel\n#\nThe following is based on\nhttps://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:UEFI#Booting_a_custom_kernel\n.\nSecure Boot does not prevent you from using a self-compiled kernel. You\n    must sign it with your own certificate and make that certificate known to\n    the firmware or MOK.\nCreate a custom X.509 key and certificate used for signing:\nopenssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.asc \\\n  -out cert.pem -nodes -days 666 -subj \"/CN=$USER/\"\nFor more information about creating certificates, see\nhttps://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:UEFI_Image_File_Sign_Tools#Create_Your_Own_Certificate\n.\nPackage the key and the certificate as a PKCS#12 structure:\n>\nopenssl pkcs12 -export -inkey key.asc -in cert.pem \\\n  -name kernel_cert -out cert.p12\nGenerate an NSS database for use with\npesign\n:\n>\ncertutil -d . -N\nImport the key and the certificate contained in PKCS#12 into the NSS\n      database:\n>\npk12util -d . -i cert.p12\n“\nBless\n”\nthe kernel with the new signature using\npesign\n:\n>\npesign -n . -c kernel_cert -i arch/x86/boot/bzImage \\\n  -o vmlinuz.signed -s\nList the signatures on the kernel image:\n>\npesign -n . -S -i vmlinuz.signed\nAt that point, you can install the kernel in\n/boot\nas usual. Because the kernel now has a custom signature the certificate\n      used for signing needs to be imported into the UEFI firmware or MOK.\nConvert the certificate to the DER format for import into the firmware or\n      MOK:\n>\nopenssl x509 -in cert.pem -outform der -out cert.der\nCopy the certificate to the ESP for easier access:\n>\nsudo\ncp cert.der /boot/efi/\nUse\nmokutil\nto launch the MOK list automatically.\nImport the certificate to MOK:\n>\nmokutil --root-pw --import cert.der\nThe\n--root-pw\noption enables usage of the\nroot\nuser directly.\nCheck the list of certificates that are prepared to be enrolled:\n>\nmokutil --list-new\nReboot the system;\nshim\nshould launch\n          MokManager. You need to enter the\nroot\npassword to confirm the\n          import of the certificate to the MOK list.\nCheck if the newly imported key was enrolled:\n>\nmokutil --list-enrolled\nAlternatively, this is the procedure if you want to launch MOK\n          manually:\nReboot\nIn the GRUB 2 menu press the '\nc\n' key.\nType:\nchainloader $efibootdir/MokManager.efi\nboot\nSelect\nEnroll key from disk\n.\nNavigate to the\ncert.der\nfile and press\nEnter\n.\nFollow the instructions to enroll the key. Normally this should be\n          pressing '\n0\n' and then '\ny\n' to\n          confirm.\nAlternatively, the firmware menu may provide ways to add a new key to\n          the Signature Database.\n17.1.4\nUsing non-inbox drivers\n#\nThere is no support for adding non-inbox drivers (that is, drivers that do\n    not come with\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n) during installation with Secure Boot enabled. The\n    signing key used for SolidDriver/PLDP is not trusted by default.\nIt is possible to install third party drivers during installation with\n    Secure Boot enabled in two different ways. In both cases:\nAdd the needed keys to the firmware database via firmware/system\n      management tools before the installation. This option depends on the\n      specific hardware you are using. Consult your hardware vendor for more\n      information.\nUse a bootable driver ISO from\nhttps://drivers.suse.com/\nor your hardware vendor to\n      enroll the needed keys in the MOK list at first boot.\nTo use the bootable driver ISO to enroll the driver keys to the MOK list,\n    follow these steps:\nBurn the ISO image above to an empty CD/DVD medium.\nStart the installation using the new CD/DVD medium, having the standard\n      installation media at hand or a URL to a network installation\n      server.\nIf doing a network installation, enter the URL of the network\n      installation source on the boot command line using the\ninstall=\noption.\nIf doing installation from optical media, the installer will first boot\n      from the driver kit and then ask to insert the first installation disk of\n      the product.\nAn initrd containing updated drivers will be used for installation.\nFor more information, see\nhttps://drivers.suse.com/doc/Usage/Secure_Boot_Certificate.html\n.\n17.1.5\nFeatures and limitations\n#\nWhen booting in Secure Boot mode, the following features apply:\nInstallation to UEFI default boot loader location, a mechanism to keep or\n      restore the EFI boot entry.\nReboot via UEFI.\nXen hypervisor will boot with UEFI when there is no legacy BIOS to fall\n      back to.\nUEFI IPv6 PXE boot support.\nUEFI videomode support, the kernel can retrieve video mode from UEFI\n      to configure KMS mode with the same parameters.\nUEFI booting from USB devices is supported.\nSince SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP3, Kexec and Kdump are supported in\n      Secure Boot mode.\nWhen booting in Secure Boot mode, the following limitations apply:\nTo ensure that Secure Boot cannot be easily circumvented, some kernel\n      features are disabled when running under Secure Boot.\nBoot loader, kernel, and kernel modules must be signed.\nHibernation (suspend on disk) is disabled.\nAccess to\n/dev/kmem\nand\n/dev/mem\nis not possible, not even as root user.\nAccess to the I/O port is not possible, not even as root user. All X11\n      graphical drivers must use a kernel driver.\nPCI BAR access through sysfs is not possible.\ncustom_method\nin ACPI is not available.\ndebugfs for asus-wmi module is not available.\nthe\nacpi_rsdp\nparameter does not have any effect on\n      the kernel.\n17.2\nMore information\n#\nhttps://www.uefi.org\n—UEFI home page where you\n     can find the current UEFI specifications.\nBlog posts by Olaf Kirch and Vojtěch Pavlík (the chapter above is\n     heavily based on these posts):\nhttps://www.suse.com/c/uefi-secure-boot-plan/\nhttps://www.suse.com/c/uefi-secure-boot-overview/\nhttps://www.suse.com/c/uefi-secure-boot-details/\nhttps://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:UEFI\n—UEFI with\n     openSUSE.\nOn this page\n17.1\nSecure boot\n17.2\nMore information\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

The boot procedure as a whole is outlined in\nChapter 16,\nIntroduction to the boot process\n. For details on Secure Boot support for UEFI machines,\n    see\nChapter 17,\nUEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)\n.\n18.1\nMain differences between GRUB legacy and GRUB 2\n#\nThe configuration is stored in different files.\nMore file systems are supported (for example, Btrfs).\nCan directly read files stored on LVM or RAID devices.\nThe user interface can be translated and altered with themes.\nIncludes a mechanism for loading modules to support additional features,\n     such as file systems, etc.\nAutomatically searches for and generates boot entries for other kernels\n     and operating systems, such as Windows.\nIncludes a minimal Bash-like console.\n18.2\nConfiguration file structure\n#\nThe configuration of GRUB 2 is based on the following files:\n/boot/grub2/grub.cfg\nThis file contains the configuration of the GRUB 2 menu items. It\n            replaces\nmenu.lst\nused in GRUB Legacy.\ngrub.cfg\nshould not be edited—it is\n            automatically generated by the command\ngrub2-mkconfig -o\n            /boot/grub2/grub.cfg\n.\n/boot/grub2/custom.cfg\nThis optional file is directly sourced by\ngrub.cfg\nat boot time and can be used to add\n            custom items to the boot menu. Starting with\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n12 SP2\nthese entries are also parsed when using\ngrub-once\n.\n/etc/default/grub\nThis file controls the user settings of GRUB 2 and normally\n            includes additional environmental settings such as backgrounds and\n            themes.\nScripts under\n/etc/grub.d/\nThe scripts in this directory are read during execution of the\n            command\ngrub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg\n.\n            Their instructions are integrated into the main configuration file\n/boot/grub/grub.cfg\n.\n/etc/sysconfig/bootloader\nThis configuration file holds certain basic settings like the boot\n            loader type and whether to enable UEFI Secure Boot support.\n/boot/grub2/x86_64-efi\n,\n/boot/grub2/power-ieee1275\n,\n/boot/grub2/s390x\nThese configuration files contain architecture-specific options.\nGRUB 2 can be controlled in various ways. Boot entries from an existing\n   configuration can be selected from the graphical menu (splash screen). The\n   configuration is loaded from the file\n/boot/grub2/grub.cfg\nwhich is compiled from other\n   configuration files (see below). All GRUB 2 configuration files are\n   considered system files, and you need\nroot\nprivileges to edit them.\nNote: Activating configuration changes\nAfter having manually edited GRUB 2 configuration files, you need to\n        run\ngrub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg\nto\n        activate the changes. However, this is not necessary when changing the\n        configuration with YaST, because YaST automatically runs this\n        command.\n18.2.1\nThe file\n/boot/grub2/grub.cfg\n#\nThe graphical splash screen with the boot menu is based on the GRUB 2\n    configuration file\n/boot/grub2/grub.cfg\n, which\n    contains information about all partitions or operating systems that can be\n    booted by the menu.\nEvery time the system is booted, GRUB 2 loads the menu file directly from\n    the file system. For this reason, GRUB 2 does not need to be re-installed\n    after changes to the configuration file.\ngrub.cfg\nis\n    automatically rebuilt with kernel installations or removals.\ngrub.cfg\nis compiled from the file\n/etc/default/grub\nand scripts found in the\n/etc/grub.d/\ndirectory when running the command\ngrub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg\n. Therefore you should never\n    edit the file manually. Instead, edit the related source files or use the\n    YaST\nBoot Loader\nmodule to modify the configuration as\n    described in\nSection 18.3, “Configuring the boot loader with YaST”\n.\n18.2.2\nThe file\n/etc/default/grub\n#\nMore general options of GRUB 2 belong in this file, such as the time the menu\n        is displayed, or the default OS to boot. To list all available options,\n        see the output of the following command:\n>\ngrep \"export GRUB_DEFAULT\" -A50 /usr/sbin/grub2-mkconfig | grep GRUB_\nYou can introduce custom variables and use them later in the scripts\n        found in the\n/etc/grub.d\ndirectory.\nAfter having edited\n/etc/default/grub\n, update the\n        main configuration file with\ngrub2-mkconfig -o\n        /boot/grub2/grub.cfg\n.\nNote: Scope\nAll options specified in this file are general options that affect all\n          boot entries. Options specific to a Xen hypervisor include the\n_XEN_\nsubstring.\nImportant: Escaping inner quotes\nMore complex options with spaces require quoting so that they are\n          processed as one option. Such inner quotes need to be correctly\n          escaped, for example:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_XEN=\"debug loglevel=9 log_buf_len=5M \\\"ddebug_query=file drivers/xen/xen-acpi-processor.c +p\\\"\"\nGRUB_DEFAULT\nSets the boot menu entry that is booted by default. Its value can\n              be a numeric value, the complete name of a menu entry, or\n“\nsaved\n”\n.\nGRUB_DEFAULT=2\nboots the third (counted from\n              zero) boot menu entry.\nGRUB_DEFAULT=\"2>0\"\nboots the first submenu\n              entry of the third top-level menu entry.\nGRUB_DEFAULT=\"Example boot menu entry\"\nboots\n              the menu entry with the title\n“\nExample boot menu\n              entry\n”\n.\nGRUB_DEFAULT=saved\nboots the entry specified\n              by the\ngrub2-once\nor\ngrub2-set-default\ncommands. While\ngrub2-reboot\nsets the default boot entry for\n              the next reboot only,\ngrub2-set-default\nsets\n              the default boot entry until changed.\ngrub2-editenv\n              list\nlists the next boot entry.\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT\nWaits the specified number of seconds for the user to press a\n              key. During the period no menu is shown unless the user presses a\n              key. If no key is pressed during the time specified, the control\n              is passed to\nGRUB_TIMEOUT\n.\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\nfirst checks whether\nShift\nis pressed and shows the boot menu if\n              yes, otherwise immediately boots the default menu entry. This is\n              the default when only one bootable OS is identified by GRUB 2.\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET\nIf\nfalse\nis specified, a countdown timer is\n              displayed on a blank screen when the\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT\nfeature is active.\nGRUB_TIMEOUT\nTime period in seconds the boot menu is displayed before\n              automatically booting the default boot entry. If you press a key,\n              the timeout is cancelled and GRUB 2 waits for you to make the\n              selection manually.\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=-1\ncauses\n              the menu to be displayed until you select the boot entry\n              manually.\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX\nEntries on this line are added at the end of the boot entries for\n              normal and recovery modes. Use it to add kernel parameters to the\n              boot entry.\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT\nSame as\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX\nbut the entries are\n              appended in the normal mode only.\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_RECOVERY\nSame as\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX\nbut the entries are\n              appended in the recovery mode only.\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_XEN_REPLACE\nThis entry replaces the\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX\nparameters for all Xen boot entries.\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_XEN_REPLACE_DEFAULT\nSame as\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_XEN_REPLACE\nbut it\n              only replaces parameters\n              of\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT\n.\nGRUB_CMDLINE_XEN\nThese entries are passed to the Xen hypervisor Xen menu\n              entries for normal and recovery modes. For example:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_XEN=\"loglvl=all guest_loglvl=all\"\nTip: Xen hypervisor options\nFind a complete list of Xen hypervisor options in\nhttps://xenbits.xen.org/docs/unstable/misc/xen-command-line.html\nGRUB_CMDLINE_XEN_DEFAULT\nSame as\nGRUB_CMDLINE_XEN\nbut the entries are\n              appended in the normal mode only.\nGRUB_TERMINAL\nEnables and specifies an input/output terminal device. Can be\nconsole\n(PC BIOS and EFI consoles),\nserial\n(serial terminal),\nofconsole\n(Open Firmware console), or the\n              default\ngfxterm\n(graphics-mode output). It is\n              also possible to enable more than one device by quoting the\n              required options, for example,\nGRUB_TERMINAL=\"console\n              serial\"\n.\nGRUB_GFXMODE\nThe resolution used for the\ngfxterm\ngraphical\n              terminal. You can only use modes supported by your graphics card\n              (VBE). The default is ‘auto’, which tries to select a preferred\n              resolution. You can display the screen resolutions available to\n              GRUB 2 by typing\nvideoinfo\nin the GRUB 2\n              command line. The command line is accessed by typing\nC\nwhen the GRUB 2 boot menu screen is displayed.\nYou can also specify a color depth by appending it to the\n              resolution setting, for example,\nGRUB_GFXMODE=1280x1024x24\n.\nGRUB_BACKGROUND\nSet a background image for the\ngfxterm\ngraphical terminal. The image must be a file readable by GRUB 2\n              at boot time, and it must end with the\n.png\n,\n.tga\n,\n.jpg\n, or\n.jpeg\nsuffix. If necessary, the image is\n              scaled to fit the screen.\nGRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER\nIf this option is set to\ntrue\n, automatic\n              searching for other operating systems is disabled. Only the\n              kernel images in\n/boot/\nand the options from\n              your own scripts in\n/etc/grub.d/\nare\n              detected.\nSUSE_BTRFS_SNAPSHOT_BOOTING\nIf this option is set to\ntrue\n, GRUB 2 can boot\n              directly into Snapper snapshots. For more information, see\nSection 10.3, “System rollback by booting from snapshots”\n.\nFor a complete list of options, see the\nGNU GRUB manual\n.\n18.2.3\nScripts in\n/etc/grub.d\n#\nThe scripts in this directory are read during execution of the command\ngrub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg\n. Their\n        instructions are incorporated into\n/boot/grub2/grub.cfg\n. The order of menu items in\ngrub.cfg\nis determined by the order in which the\n        files in this directory are run. Files with a leading numeral are\n        executed first, beginning with the lowest number.\n00_header\nis run before\n10_linux\n, which would run before\n40_custom\n. If files with alphabetic names are\n        present, they are executed after the numerically named files. Only\n        executable files generate output to\ngrub.cfg\nduring execution of\ngrub2-mkconfig\n. By default all\n        files in the\n/etc/grub.d\ndirectory are executable.\nTip: Persistent custom content in\ngrub.cfg\nBecause\n/boot/grub2/grub.cfg\nis recompiled each\n          time\ngrub2-mkconfig\nis run, any custom content is\n          lost. To insert your lines directly into\n/boot/grub2/grub.cfg\nwithout losing them after\ngrub2-mkconfig\nis run, insert them between\n### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/90_persistent ###\nand\n### END /etc/grub.d/90_persistent ###\nThe\n90_persistent\nscript ensures that such\n          content is preserved.\nA list of the most important scripts follows:\n00_header\nSets environmental variables such as system file locations,\n              display settings, themes and previously saved entries. It also\n              imports preferences stored in the\n/etc/default/grub\n. Normally you do not need\n              to make changes to this file.\n10_linux\nIdentifies Linux kernels on the root device and creates relevant\n              menu entries. This includes the associated recovery mode option\n              if enabled. Only the latest kernel is displayed on the main menu\n              page, with additional kernels included in a submenu.\n30_os-prober\nThis script uses\nos-prober\nto search for Linux\n              and other operating systems and places the results in the GRUB 2\n              menu. There are sections to identify specific other operating\n              systems, such as Windows or macOS.\n40_custom\nThis file provides a simple way to include custom boot entries\n              into\ngrub.cfg\n. Make sure that you do not\n              change the\nexec tail -n +3 $0\npart at the\n              beginning.\nThe processing sequence is set by the preceding numbers with the lowest\n        number being executed first. If scripts are preceded by the same number\n        the alphabetical order of the complete name decides the order.\nTip:\n/boot/grub2/custom.cfg\nIf you create\n/boot/grub2/custom.cfg\nand fill it\n          with content, it is automatically included into\n/boot/grub2/grub.cfg\nright after\n40_custom\nat boot time.\n18.2.4\nMapping between BIOS drives and Linux devices\n#\nIn GRUB Legacy, the\ndevice.map\nconfiguration file\n        was used to derive Linux device names from BIOS drive numbers. The\n        mapping between BIOS drives and Linux devices cannot always be guessed\n        correctly. For example, GRUB Legacy would get a wrong order if the boot\n        sequence of IDE and SCSI drives is exchanged in the BIOS configuration.\nGRUB 2 avoids this problem by using device ID strings (UUIDs) or file\n        system labels when generating\ngrub.cfg\n. GRUB 2\n        utilities create a temporary device map on the fly, which is normally\n        sufficient, particularly for single-disk systems.\nHowever, if you need to override the GRUB 2's automatic device mapping\n        mechanism, create your custom mapping file\n/boot/grub2/device.map\n. The following example\n        changes the mapping to make\nDISK 3\nthe boot disk.\n        GRUB 2 partition numbers start with\n1\nand\n        not with\n0\nas in GRUB 2 Legacy.\n(hd1)  /dev/disk-by-id/\nDISK3 ID\n(hd2)  /dev/disk-by-id/\nDISK1 ID\n(hd3)  /dev/disk-by-id/\nDISK2 ID\n18.2.5\nEditing menu entries during the boot procedure\n#\nBeing able to directly edit menu entries is useful when the system does\n        not boot anymore because of a faulty configuration. It can also be used\n        to test new settings without altering the system configuration.\nIn the graphical boot menu, select the entry you want to edit with\n            the arrow keys.\nPress\nE\nto open the text-based editor.\nUse the arrow keys to move to the line you want to edit.\nFigure 18.1:\nGRUB 2 boot editor\n#\nNow you have two options:\nAdd space-separated parameters to the end of the line starting\n                with\nlinux\nor\nlinuxefi\nto\n                edit the kernel parameters. A complete list of parameters is\n                available at\nhttps://en.opensuse.org/Linuxrc\n.\nOr edit the general options to change, for example, the kernel\n                version. The\n→|\nkey suggests all possible\n                completions.\nPress\nF10\nto boot the system with the changes you\n            made or press\nEsc\nto discard your edits and\n            return to the GRUB 2 menu.\nChanges made this way only apply to the current boot process and are\n        not saved permanently.\nImportant: Keyboard layout during the boot procedure\nThe US keyboard layout is the only one available when booting. See\nFigure 12.1, “US keyboard layout”\n.\nNote: Boot loader on the installation media\nThe Boot Loader of the installation media on systems with a\n          traditional BIOS is still GRUB Legacy. To add boot parameters, select\n          an entry and start typing. Additions you make to the installation\n          boot entry are permanently saved in the installed system.\nNote: Editing GRUB 2 menu entries on IBM Z\nCursor movement and editing commands on IBM Z differ—see\nSection 18.4, “Differences in terminal usage on IBM Z”\nfor details.\n18.2.6\nSetting a boot password\n#\nEven before the operating system is booted, GRUB 2 enables access to file\n    systems. Users without root permissions can access files in your Linux\n    system to which they have no access after the system is booted. To block\n    this kind of access or to prevent users from booting certain menu entries,\n    set a boot password.\nImportant: Booting requires a password\nIf set, the boot password is required on every boot, which means the\n     system does not boot automatically.\nProceed as follows to set a boot password. Alternatively use YaST\n    (\nProtect Boot Loader with Password\n).\nEncrypt the password using\ngrub2-mkpasswd-pbkdf2:\n>\nsudo\ngrub2-mkpasswd-pbkdf2\nPassword: ****\nReenter password: ****\nPBKDF2 hash of your password is grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.9CA4611006FE96BC77A...\nPaste the resulting string into the file\n/etc/grub.d/40_custom\ntogether with the\nset\n      superusers\ncommand.\nset superusers=\"root\"\npassword_pbkdf2 root grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.9CA4611006FE96BC77A...\nTo import the changes into the main configuration file, run:\n>\nsudo\ngrub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg\nAfter you reboot, GRUB 2 prompts you for a user name and a password\n        when trying to boot a menu entry. Enter\nroot\nand the\n        password you typed during the\ngrub2-mkpasswd-pbkdf2\ncommand. If the credentials are correct, the system boots the\n        selected boot entry.\nFor more information, see\nhttps://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub.html#Security\n.\n18.2.7\nAuthorized access to boot menu entries\n#\nYou can configure GRUB 2 to allow access to boot menu entries depending\n    on the level of authorization. You can configure multiple user accounts\n    protected with passwords and assign them access to different menu entries.\n    To configure authorization in GRUB 2, follow these steps:\nCreate and encrypt one password for each user account you want to use in\n      GRUB 2. Use the\ngrub2-mkpasswd-pbkdf2\ncommand as\n      described in\nSection 18.2.6, “Setting a boot password”\n.\nDelete the file\n/etc/grub.d/10_linux\n.\n      This prevents outputting the default GRUB 2 menu entries.\nEdit the\n/boot/grub2/custom.cfg\nfile and add custom\n      menu entries manually. The following template is an example, adjust\n      it to better match your use case:\nset superusers=admin\npassword admin\nADMIN_PASSWORD\npassword maintainer\nMAINTAINER_PASSWORD\nmenuentry 'Operational mode' {\n  insmod ext2\n  set root=hd0,1\n  echo 'Loading Linux ...'\n  linux /boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/vda1 $GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT $GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX mode=operation\n  echo 'Loading Initrd ...'\n  initrd /boot/initrd\n}\n\nmenuentry 'Maintenance mode' --users maintainer {\n  insmod ext2\n  set root=hd0,1\n  echo 'Loading Linux ...'\n  linux /boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/vda1 $GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT $GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX mode=maintenance\n  echo 'Loading Initrd ...'\n  initrd /boot/initrd\n}\nImport the changes into the main configuration file:\n>\nsudo\ngrub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg\nIn the above example:\nThe GRUB 2 menu has two entries,\nOperational mode\nand\nMaintenance mode\n.\nIf no user is specified, both boot menu entries are accessible, but\n      no one can access GRUB 2 command line or edit existing menu entries.\nadmin\nuser can access GRUB 2 command line and edit\n      existing menu entries.\nmaintenance\nuser can select the recovery menu item.\n18.3\nConfiguring the boot loader with YaST\n#\nThe easiest way to configure general options of the boot loader in your\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nsystem is to use the YaST module. In the\nYaST Control Center\n, select\nSystem\n›\nBoot\n  Loader\n. The module shows the current boot loader\n  configuration of your system and allows you to make changes.\nUse the\nBoot Code Options\ntab to view and change settings\n  related to type, location and advanced loader settings. You can choose\n  whether to use GRUB 2 in standard or EFI mode.\nImportant: EFI systems require GRUB2-EFI\nIf you have an EFI system you can only install GRUB2-EFI, otherwise your\n   system is no longer bootable.\nImportant: Reinstalling the boot loader\nTo reinstall the boot loader, make sure to change a setting in YaST and\n   then change it back. For example, to reinstall GRUB2-EFI, select\nGRUB2\nfirst and then immediately switch back to\nGRUB2-EFI\n.\nOtherwise, the boot loader may only be partially reinstalled.\nNote: Custom boot loader\nTo use a boot loader other than the ones listed, select\nDo Not\n   Install Any Boot Loader\n. Read the documentation of your boot\n   loader carefully before choosing this option.\n18.3.1\nBoot loader location and boot code options\n#\nThe default location of the boot loader depends on the partition setup and\n   is either the Master Boot Record (MBR) or the boot sector of the\n/\npartition. To modify the location of the boot loader,\n   follow these steps:\nProcedure 18.1:\nChanging the boot loader location\n#\nSelect the\nBoot Code Options\ntab and then choose one of\n     the following options for\nBoot Loader Location\n:\nBoot from Master Boot Record\nThis installs the boot loader in the MBR of the disk containing the\n        directory\n/boot\n. Usually this will be the disk\n        mounted to\n/\n, but if\n/boot\nis\n        mounted to a separate partition on a different disk, the MBR of that\n        disk will be used.\nBoot from Root Partition\nThis installs the boot loader in the boot sector of the\n/\npartition.\nCustom Root Partition\nUse this option to specify the location of the boot loader manually.\nClick\nOK\nto apply the changes.\nFigure 18.2:\nBoot code options\n#\nThe\nBoot Code Options\ntab includes the following\n   additional options:\nSet Active Flag in Partition Table for Boot\n      Partition\nActivates the partition that contains the\n/boot\ndirectory. For POWER systems it\n       activates the PReP partition. Use this option on systems with\n       old BIOS and/or legacy operating systems because they may fail\n       to boot from a non-active partition. It is safe to leave this\n       option active.\nWrite Generic Boot Code to MBR\nIf MBR contains a custom 'non-GRUB' code, this option replaces it with a\n       generic, operating system independent code. If you deactivate this\n       option, the system may become unbootable.\nEnable Trusted Boot Support\nStarts TrustedGRUB2, which supports trusted computing functionality\n       (Trusted Platform Module (TPM)). For more information refer to\nhttps://github.com/Sirrix-AG/TrustedGRUB2\n.\nThe\nProtective MBR flag\nsection includes the following\n      options:\nset\nThis is appropriate for traditional legacy BIOS booting.\nremove\nThis is appropriate for UEFI booting.\ndo not change\nThis is usually the best choice if you have an already working\n       system.\nIn most cases YaST defaults to the appropriate choice.\n18.3.2\nAdjusting the disk order\n#\nIf your computer has more than one hard disk, you can specify the boot\n   sequence of the disks. The first disk in the list is where GRUB 2 will be\n   installed in the case of booting from MBR. It is the disk where\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nis installed by default. The rest of the list is a hint for\n   GRUB 2's device mapper (see\nSection 18.2.4, “Mapping between BIOS drives and Linux devices”\n).\nWarning: Unbootable system\nThe default value is usually valid for almost all deployments. If you change\n    the boot order of disks wrongly, the system may become unbootable on the\n    next reboot. For example, if the first disk in the list is not part of the\n    BIOS boot order, and the other disks in the list have empty MBRs.\nProcedure 18.2:\nSetting the disk order\n#\nOpen the\nBoot Code Options\ntab.\nClick\nEdit Disk Boot Order\n.\nIf more than one disk is listed, select a disk and click\nUp\nor\nDown\nto reorder the displayed\n     disks.\nClick\nOK\ntwo times to save the changes.\n18.3.3\nConfiguring advanced options\n#\nAdvanced boot parameters can be configured via the\nBoot Loader\n   Options\ntab.\n18.3.3.1\nBoot Loader Options\ntab\n#\nFigure 18.3:\nBoot loader options\n#\nBoot Loader Time-Out\nChange the value of\nTime-Out in Seconds\nby typing in\n       a new value and clicking the appropriate arrow key with your mouse.\nProbe Foreign OS\nWhen selected, the boot loader searches for other systems like Windows\n       or other Linux installations.\nHide Menu on Boot\nHides the boot menu and boots the default entry.\nAdjusting the Default Boot Entry\nSelect the desired entry from the\n“\nDefault Boot Section\n”\nlist. Note that the\n“\n>\n”\nsign in the boot entry name\n       delimits the boot section and its subsection.\nProtect Boot Loader with Password\nProtects the boot loader and the system with an additional password. For\n       details on manual configuration, see\nSection 18.2.6, “Setting a boot password”\n.\n       If this option is activated, the boot password is required on every boot,\n       which means the system does not boot automatically. However, if you prefer\n       the behavior of GRUB 1, additionally enable\nProtect Entry\n       Modification Only\n. With this setting, anybody is allowed to select\n       a boot entry and boot the system, whereas the password for the GRUB 2\nroot\nuser is only required for modifying boot entries.\n18.3.3.2\nKernel Parameters\ntab\n#\nFigure 18.4:\nKernel parameters\n#\nOptional Kernel Command Line Parameter\nSpecify optional kernel parameters here to enable/disable system\n       features, add drivers, etc.\nCPU Mitigations\nSUSE has released one or more kernel boot command line parameters for\n       all software mitigations that have been deployed to prevent CPU side-channel\n       attacks. Some of those may result in performance loss. Choose\n       one the following options to strike a balance between security and\n       performance, depending on your setting:\nAuto\n.\nEnables all mitigations required for your CPU model, but does\n   not protect against cross-CPU thread attacks. This setting may impact\n   performance to some degree, depending on the workload.\nAuto + No SMT\n.\nProvides the full set of available security mitigations. Enables all\n    mitigations required for your CPU model. In addition, it disables\n    Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) to avoid side-channel attacks across\n    multiple CPU threads. This setting may further impact performance,\n    depending on the workload.\nOff\n.\nDisables all mitigations. Side-channel attacks against your CPU\n    are possible, depending on the CPU model. This setting has no impact\n    on performance.\nManual\n.\nDoes not set any mitigation level. Specify your CPU mitigations manually\n    by using the kernel command line options.\nUse Graphical Console\nWhen checked, the boot menu appears on a graphical splash screen rather\n       than in a text mode. The resolution of the boot screen is set\n       automatically by default, but you can manually set it\n       via\nConsole resolution\n. The graphical theme\n       definition file can be specified with the\nConsole\n       theme\nfile chooser. Only change this if you want to apply\n       your own, custom-made theme.\nUse Serial Console\nIf your machine is controlled via a serial console, activate this option\n       and specify which COM port to use at which speed. See\ninfo\n       grub\nor\nhttp://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub.html#Serial-terminal\n18.4\nDifferences in terminal usage on IBM Z\n#\nOn 3215 and 3270 terminals there are some differences and limitations on how\n   to move the cursor and how to issue editing commands within GRUB 2.\n18.4.1\nLimitations\n#\nInteractivity\nInteractivity is strongly limited. Typing often does not result in\n       visual feedback. To see where the cursor is, type an underscore\n       (\n_\n).\nNote: 3270 compared to 3215\nThe 3270 terminal is much better at displaying and refreshing screens\n        than the 3215 terminal.\nCursor movement\n“\nTraditional\n”\ncursor movement is not possible.\nAlt\n,\nMeta\n,\nCtrl\nand the cursor keys do not work.

All other programs are started directly by\nsystemd\nor by one of its child processes.\nsystemd\nis a replacement for\n    the System V init daemon and is fully compatible with System V init (by\n    supporting init scripts).\nThe main advantage of\nsystemd\nis that it considerably speeds up boot time\n    by parallelizing service starts. Furthermore,\nsystemd\nonly starts a\n    service when it is really needed. Daemons are not started unconditionally\n    at boot time, but when being required for the first time.\nsystemd\nalso\n    supports Kernel Control Groups (cgroups), creating snapshots, and restoring\n    the system state. For more details see\nhttp://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/\n.\n19.1\nThe\nsystemd\nconcept\n#\nThe following section explains the concept behind\nsystemd\n.\nsystemd\nis a system and session manager for Linux, compatible with System V\n    and LSB init scripts.\n    The main features of\nsystemd\ninclude:\nparallelization capabilities\nsocket and D-Bus activation for starting services\non-demand starting of daemons\ntracking of processes using Linux cgroups\ncreating snapshots and restoring of the system state\nmaintains mount and automount points\nimplements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control\n      logic\n19.1.1\nUnit file\n#\nA unit configuration file contains information about a service, a\n        socket, a device, a mount point, an automount point, a swap file or\n        partition, a start-up target, a watched file system path, a timer\n        controlled and supervised by\nsystemd\n, a temporary system state\n        snapshot, a resource management slice or a group of externally created\n        processes.\n“\nUnit file\n”\nis a generic term used by\nsystemd\nfor the\n        following:\nService.\nInformation about a process (for example, running a daemon); file\n              ends with .service\nTargets.\nUsed for grouping units and as synchronization points during\n              start-up; file ends with .target\nSockets.\nInformation about an IPC or network socket or a file system FIFO,\n              for socket-based activation (like\ninetd\n); file ends with\n              .socket\nPath.\nUsed to trigger other units (for example, running a service when\n              files change); file ends with .path\nTimer.\nInformation about a timer controlled, for timer-based activation;\n              file ends with .timer\nMount point.\nNormally auto-generated by the fstab generator; file ends with\n              .mount\nAutomount point.\nInformation about a file system automount point; file ends with\n              .automount\nSwap.\nInformation about a swap device or file for memory paging; file\n              ends with .swap\nDevice.\nInformation about a device unit as exposed in the sysfs/udev(7)\n              device tree; file ends with .device\nScope / slice.\nA concept for hierarchically managing resources of a group of\n              processes; file ends with .scope/.slice\nFor more information about\nsystemd\nunit files, see\nhttp://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html\n19.2\nBasic usage\n#\nThe System V init system uses several commands to handle\n      services—the init scripts,\ninsserv\n,\ntelinit\nand others.\nsystemd\nmakes it easier to\n      manage services, because there is only one command to handle most service\n      related tasks:\nsystemctl\n. It uses the\n“\ncommand\n      plus subcommand\n”\nnotation like\ngit\nor\nzypper\n:\nsystemctl\nGENERAL OPTIONS\nSUBCOMMAND\nSUBCOMMAND OPTIONS\nSee\nman 1 systemctl\nfor a complete manual.\nTip: Terminal output and Bash completion\nIf the output goes to a terminal (and not to a pipe or a file, for example),\nsystemd\ncommands send long output to a pager by default.\n    Use the\n--no-pager\noption to turn off paging mode.\nsystemd\nalso supports bash-completion, allowing you to enter the first letters of a subcommand and then press\n→|\n.\n    This feature is only available in the\nbash\nshell and requires the installation of the package\nbash-completion\n.\n19.2.1\nManaging services in a running system\n#\nSubcommands for managing services are the same as for managing a service with System V init (\nstart\n,\nstop\n, ...).\n    The general syntax for service management commands is as follows:\nsystemd\nsystemctl reload|restart|start|status|stop|\n...\nMY_SERVICE(S)\nSystem V init\nrc\nMY_SERVICE(S)\nreload|restart|start|status|stop|\n...\nsystemd\nallows you to manage several services in one go.\n    Instead of executing init scripts one after the other as with System V init, execute a command like the following:\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl start\nMY_1ST_SERVICE\nMY_2ND_SERVICE\nTo list all services available on the system:\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl list-unit-files --type=service\nThe following table lists the most important service management commands for\nsystemd\nand System V init:\nTable 19.1:\nService management commands\n#\nTask\nsystemd\nCommand\nSystem V init Command\nStarting.\nstart\nstart\nStopping.\nstop\nstop\nRestarting.\nShuts down services and starts them afterward.

You can either do\n        this by using YaST, or on the command line.\n19.2.2.1\nEnabling/disabling services on the command line\n#\nThe following table lists enabling and disabling commands for\nsystemd\nand System V init:\nImportant: Service start\nWhen enabling a service on the command line, it is not started\n            automatically. It is scheduled to be started with the next system\n            start-up or runlevel/target change. To immediately start a service\n            after having enabled it, explicitly run\nsystemctl start\nMY_SERVICE\nor\nrc\nMY_SERVICE\nstart\n.\nTable 19.2:\nCommands for enabling and disabling services\n#\nTask\nsystemd\nCommand\nSystem V init Command\nEnabling.\nsystemctl enable\nMY_SERVICE(S)\ninsserv\nMY_SERVICE(S)\n,\nchkconfig -a\nMY_SERVICE(S)\nDisabling.\nsystemctl disable\nMY_SERVICE(S)\n.service\ninsserv -r\nMY_SERVICE(S)\n,\nchkconfig -d\nMY_SERVICE(S)\nChecking.\nShows whether a service is enabled or not.\nsystemctl is-enabled\nMY_SERVICE\nchkconfig\nMY_SERVICE\nRe-enabling.\nSimilar to restarting a service, this command first\n                      disables and then enables a service. Useful to re-enable\n                      a service with its defaults.\nsystemctl reenable\nMY_SERVICE\nn/a\nMasking.\nAfter\n“\ndisabling\n”\na service, it can still be\n                      started manually. To disable a service, you need to mask\n                      it. Use with care.\nsystemctl mask\nMY_SERVICE\nn/a\nUnmasking.\nA service that has been masked can only be used again\n                      after it has been unmasked.\nsystemctl unmask\nMY_SERVICE\nn/a\n19.3\nSystem start and target management\n#\nThe entire process of starting the system and shutting it down is maintained by\nsystemd\n.\n   From this point of view, the kernel can be considered a background process to maintain all other processes and adjust CPU time and hardware access according to requests from other programs.\n19.3.1\nTargets compared to runlevels\n#\nWith System V init the system was booted into a so-called\n“\nRunlevel\n”\n. A runlevel defines how the system is started\n        and what services are available in the running system. Runlevels are\n        numbered; the most commonly known ones are\n0\n(shutting down the system),\n3\n(multiuser with\n        network) and\n5\n(multiuser with network and display\n        manager).\nsystemd\nintroduces a new concept by using so-called\n“\ntarget\n        units\n”\n. However, it remains fully compatible with the runlevel\n        concept. Target units are named rather than numbered and serve specific\n        purposes. For example, the targets\nlocal-fs.target\nand\nswap.target\nmount local file systems and swap\n        spaces.\nThe target\ngraphical.target\nprovides a\n        multiuser system with network and display manager capabilities and is\n        equivalent to runlevel 5. Complex targets, such as\ngraphical.target\nact as\n“\nmeta\n”\ntargets by combining a subset of other targets. Since\nsystemd\nmakes\n        it easy to create custom targets by combining existing targets, it\n        offers great flexibility.\nThe following list shows the most important\nsystemd\ntarget units. For\n        a full list refer to\nman 7 systemd.special\n.\nSelected\nsystemd\ntarget units\n#\ndefault.target\nThe target that is booted by default. Not a\n“\nreal\n”\ntarget, but rather a symbolic link to another target like\ngraphic.target\n. Can be permanently\n              changed via YaST (see\nSection 19.4, “Managing services with YaST”\n). To change it for a\n              session, use the kernel parameter\nsystemd.unit=\nMY_TARGET.target\nat the boot prompt.\nemergency.target\nStarts a minimal emergency\nroot\nshell on the console. Only\n              use it at the boot prompt as\nsystemd.unit=emergency.target\n.\ngraphical.target\nStarts a system with network, multiuser support and a display\n              manager.\nhalt.target\nShuts down the system.\nmail-transfer-agent.target\nStarts all services necessary for sending and receiving mails.\nmulti-user.target\nStarts a multiuser system with network.\nreboot.target\nReboots the system.\nrescue.target\nStarts a single-user\nroot\nsession without network. Basic\n              tools for system administration are available. The\nrescue\ntarget is suitable for solving multiple\n              system problems, for example, failing logins or fixing issues\n              with a display driver.\nTo remain compatible with the System V init runlevel system,\nsystemd\nprovides special targets named\nrunlevel\nX\n.target\nmapping\n        the corresponding runlevels numbered\nX\n.\nTo inspect the current target, use the command:\nsystemctl\n        get-default\nTable 19.3:\nSystem V runlevels and\nsystemd\ntarget units\n#\nSystem V runlevel\nsystemd\ntarget\nPurpose\n0\nrunlevel0.target\n,\nhalt.target\n,\npoweroff.target\nSystem shutdown\n1, S\nrunlevel1.target\n,\nrescue.target\n,\nSingle-user mode\n2\nrunlevel2.target\n,\nmulti-user.target\n,\nLocal multiuser without remote network\n3\nrunlevel3.target\n,\nmulti-user.target\n,\nFull multiuser with network\n4\nrunlevel4.target\nUnused/User-defined\n5\nrunlevel5.target\n,\ngraphical.target\n,\nFull multiuser with network and display manager\n6\nrunlevel6.target\n,\nreboot.target\n,\nSystem reboot\nImportant:\nsystemd\nignores\n/etc/inittab\nThe runlevels in a System V init system are configured in\n/etc/inittab\n.\nsystemd\ndoes\nnot\nuse this configuration.

The command\nsystemctl edit\nSERVICE\nstarts the default text editor and creates a directory with an empty\noverride.conf\nfile in\n/etc/systemd/system/\nNAME\n.service.d/\n. The\n        command also ensures that the running\nsystemd\nprocess is notified about the changes.\nFor example, to change the amount of time that the system waits for MariaDB to start, run\nsudo systemctl edit mariadb.service\nand edit the opened file to include\n        the modified lines only:\n# Configures the time to wait for start-up/stop\nTimeoutSec=300\nAdjust the\nTimeoutSec\nvalue and save the changes. To enable the changes,\n        run\nsudo systemctl daemon-reload\n.\nFor further information, refer to the man pages that can be evoked with\n        the\nman 1 systemctl\ncommand.\nWarning: Creating a copy of a full unit file\nIf you use the\n--full\noption in the\nsystemctl edit --full\nSERVICE\ncommand, a copy of the original unit file is\n          created where you can modify specific options. We do not recommend such customization\n          because when the unit file is updated by SUSE, its changes are overridden by the\n          customized copy in the\n/etc/systemd/system/\ndirectory. Moreover, if\n          SUSE provides updates to distribution drop-ins, they will override the copy of the unit\n          file created with\n--full\n. To prevent this confusion and always have your\n          customization valid, use drop-ins.\n19.5.3\nCreating drop-in files manually\n#\nApart from using the\nsystemctl edit\ncommand, you can create drop-ins\n        manually to have more control over their priority. Such drop-ins let you extend both unit\n        and daemon configuration files without having to edit or override the files themselves.\n        They are stored in the following directories:\n/etc/systemd/*.conf.d/\n,\n/etc/systemd/system/*.service.d/\nDrop-ins added and customized by system administrators.\n/usr/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/\n,\n/usr/lib/systemd/system/*.service.d/\nDrop-ins installed by customization packages to override upstream\n              settings. For example, SUSE ships\nsystemd-default-settings\n.\nTip\nSee the man page\nman 5 systemd.unit\nfor the full\n          list of unit search paths.\nFor example, to disable the rate limiting that is enforced by the\n        default setting of\nsystemd-journald\n, follow these steps:\nCreate a directory called\n/etc/systemd/journald.conf.d\n.\n>\nsudo\nmkdir /etc/systemd/journald.conf.d\nNote\nThe directory name must follow the service name that you want to\n              patch with the drop-in file.\nIn that directory, create a file\n/etc/systemd/journald.conf.d/60-rate-limit.conf\nwith the option that you want to override, for example:\n>\ncat /etc/systemd/journald.conf.d/60-rate-limit.conf\n# Disable rate limiting\nRateLimitIntervalSec=0\nSave your changes and restart the service of the corresponding\nsystemd\ndaemon.\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl restart systemd-journald\nNote: Avoiding name conflicts\nTo avoid name conflicts between your drop-ins and files shipped by\n          SUSE, it is recommended to prefix all drop-ins with a two-digit\n          number and a dash, for example,\n80-override.conf\n.\nThe following ranges are reserved:\n0-19\nis reserved for\nsystemd\nupstream.\n20-29\nis reserved for\nsystemd\nshipped by\n              SUSE.\n30-39\nis reserved for SUSE packages other\n              than\nsystemd\n.\n40-49\nis reserved for third party packages.\n50\nis reserved for unit drop-in files created\n              with\nsystemctl set-property\n.\nUse a two-digit number above this range to ensure that none of the\n          drop-ins shipped by SUSE can override your own drop-ins.\nTip\nYou can use\nsystemctl cat $UNIT\nto list and verify\n          which files are taken into account in the units configuration.\nTip\nBecause the configuration of\nsystemd\ncomponents can be scattered\n          across different places on the file system, it might be hard to get a\n          global overview. To inspect the configuration of a\nsystemd\ncomponent, use the following commands:\nsystemctl cat\nUNIT_PATTERN\nprints\n              configuration files related to one or more\nsystemd\nunits, for\n              example:\n>\nsystemctl cat atd.service\nsystemd-analyze cat-config\nDAEMON_NAME_OR_PATH\ncopies\n              the contents of a configuration file and drop-ins for a\nsystemd\ndaemon, for example:\n>\nsystemd-analyze cat-config systemd/journald.conf\n19.5.4\nConverting\nxinetd\nservices to\nsystemd\n#\nSince the release of\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n15, the\nxinetd\ninfrastructure has been removed.\n    This section outlines how to convert existing custom\nxinetd\nservice files to\nsystemd\nsockets.\nFor each\nxinetd\nservice file, you need at least two\nsystemd\nunit files: the socket file (\n*.socket\n) and an associated service file (\n*.service\n).\n    The socket file tells\nsystemd\nwhich socket to create, and the service file tells\nsystemd\nwhich executable to start.\nConsider the following example\nxinetd\nservice file:\n#\ncat /etc/xinetd.d/example\nservice example\n{\n  socket_type = stream\n  protocol = tcp\n  port = 10085\n  wait = no\n  user = user\n  group = users\n  groups = yes\n  server = /usr/libexec/example/exampled\n  server_args = -auth=bsdtcp exampledump\n  disable = no\n}\nTo convert it to\nsystemd\n, you need the following two matching files:\n#\ncat /usr/lib/systemd/system/example.socket\n[Socket]\nListenStream=0.0.0.0:10085\nAccept=false\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=sockets.target\n#\ncat /usr/lib/systemd/system/example.service\n[Unit]\nDescription=example\n\n[Service]\nExecStart=/usr/libexec/example/exampled -auth=bsdtcp exampledump\nUser=user\nGroup=users\nStandardInput=socket\nFor a complete list of the\nsystemd\n'socket' and 'service' file options, refer to the systemd.socket and systemd.service manual pages (\nman 5 systemd.socket\n,\nman 5 systemd.service\n).\n19.5.5\nCreating custom targets\n#\nOn System V init SUSE systems, runlevel 4 is unused to allow administrators to create their own runlevel configuration.\nsystemd\nallows you to create any number of custom targets.\n    It is suggested to start by adapting an existing target such as\ngraphical.target\n.\nCopy the configuration file\n/usr/lib/systemd/system/graphical.target\nto\n/etc/systemd/system/\nMY_TARGET\n.target\nand adjust it according to your needs.\nThe configuration file copied in the previous step already covers the required (\n“\nhard\n”\n) dependencies for the target.\n      To also cover the wanted (\n“\nsoft\n”\n) dependencies, create a directory\n/etc/systemd/system/\nMY_TARGET\n.target.wants\n.\nFor each wanted service, create a symbolic link from\n/usr/lib/systemd/system\ninto\n/etc/systemd/system/\nMY_TARGET\n.target.wants\n.\nWhen you have finished setting up the target, reload the\nsystemd\nconfiguration to make the new target available:\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl daemon-reload\n19.6\nAdvanced usage\n#\nThe following sections cover advanced topics for system administrators.\n   For even more advanced\nsystemd\ndocumentation, refer to Lennart Pöttering's series about\nsystemd\nfor administrators at\nhttp://0pointer.de/blog/projects\n.\n19.6.1\nCleaning temporary directories\n#\nsystemd\nsupports cleaning temporary directories regularly.\n    The configuration from the previous system version is automatically migrated and active.\ntmpfiles.d\n—which is responsible for managing temporary files—reads its configuration from\n/etc/tmpfiles.d/*.conf\n,\n/run/tmpfiles.d/*.conf\n, and\n/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/*.conf\nfiles.\n    Configuration placed in\n/etc/tmpfiles.d/*.conf\noverrides related configurations from the other two directories (\n/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/*.conf\nis where packages store their configuration files).\nThe configuration format is one line per path containing action and path, and optionally mode, ownership, age and argument fields, depending on the action.\n    The following example unlinks the X11 lock files:\nType Path               Mode UID  GID  Age Argument\nr    /tmp/.X[0-9]*-lock\nTo get the status the tmpfile timer:\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl status systemd-tmpfiles-clean.timer\nsystemd-tmpfiles-clean.timer - Daily Cleanup of Temporary Directories\n Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/systemd-tmpfiles-clean.timer;

This procedure is no longer supported with\nsystemd\n. If\n        you need to do actions before starting services, do the following:\nLoading kernel modules\nCreate a drop-in file in\n/etc/modules-load.d\ndirectory (see\nman modules-load.d\nfor the\n              syntax)\nCreating Files or Directories, Cleaning-up Directories, Changing Ownership\nCreate a drop-in file in\n/etc/tmpfiles.d\n(see\nman tmpfiles.d\nfor the syntax)\nOther tasks\nCreate a system service file, for example,\n/etc/systemd/system/before.service\n, from the\n              following template:\n[Unit]\nBefore=\nNAME OF THE SERVICE YOU WANT THIS SERVICE TO BE STARTED BEFORE\n[Service]\nType=oneshot\nRemainAfterExit=true\nExecStart=\nYOUR_COMMAND\n# beware, executable is run directly, not through a shell, check the man pages\n# systemd.service and systemd.unit for full syntax\n[Install]\n# target in which to start the service\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n#WantedBy=graphical.target\nWhen the service file is created, you should run the following commands (as\nroot\n):\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl daemon-reload\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl enable before\nEvery time you modify the service file, you need to run:\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl daemon-reload\n19.6.6\nKernel control groups (cgroups)\n#\nOn a traditional System V init system, it is not always possible to\n        match a process to the service that spawned it. Some services, such as\n        Apache, spawn a lot of third-party processes (for example, CGI or Java\n        processes), which themselves spawn more processes. This makes a clear\n        assignment difficult or even impossible. Additionally, a service may\n        not finish correctly, leaving certain children alive.\nsystemd\nsolves this problem by placing each service into its own\n        cgroup. cgroups are a kernel feature that allows aggregating processes\n        and all their children into hierarchical organized groups.\nsystemd\nnames each cgroup after its service. Since a non-privileged process is\n        not allowed to\n“\nleave\n”\nits cgroup, this provides an\n        effective way to label all processes spawned by a service with the name\n        of the service.\nTo list all processes belonging to a service, use the command\nsystemd-cgls\n, for example:\nExample 19.3:\nList all processes belonging to a service\n#\n#\nsystemd-cgls --no-pager\n├─1 /usr/lib/systemd/systemd --switched-root --system --deserialize 20\n├─user.slice\n│ └─user-1000.slice\n│   ├─session-102.scope\n│   │ ├─12426 gdm-session-worker [pam/gdm-password]\n│   │ ├─15831 gdm-session-worker [pam/gdm-password]\n│   │ ├─15839 gdm-session-worker [pam/gdm-password]\n│   │ ├─15858 /usr/lib/gnome-terminal-server\n\n[...]\n\n└─system.slice\n  ├─systemd-hostnamed.service\n  │ └─17616 /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-hostnamed\n  ├─cron.service\n  │ └─1689 /usr/sbin/cron -n\n  ├─postfix.service\n  │ ├─ 1676 /usr/lib/postfix/master -w\n  │ ├─ 1679 qmgr -l -t fifo -u\n  │ └─15590 pickup -l -t fifo -u\n  ├─sshd.service\n  │ └─1436 /usr/sbin/sshd -D\n\n[...]\nSee\nChapter 10,\nKernel control groups\nfor more information about cgroups.\n19.6.7\nTerminating services (sending signals)\n#\nAs explained in\nSection 19.6.6, “Kernel control groups (cgroups)”\n, it is not always possible to assign a process to its parent service process in a System V init system.\n    This makes it difficult to terminate a service and all of its children.\n    Child processes that have not been terminated will remain as zombie processes.\nsystemd\n's concept of confining each service into a cgroup makes it possible to clearly identify all child processes of a service and therefore allows you to send a signal to each of these processes.\n    Use\nsystemctl kill\nto send signals to services.\n    For a list of available signals refer to\nman 7 signals\n.\nSending\nSIGTERM\nto a service\nSIGTERM\nis the default signal that is sent.\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl kill\nMY_SERVICE\nSending\nSIGNAL\nto a service\nUse the\n-s\noption to specify the signal that should be sent.\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl kill -s\nSIGNAL\nMY_SERVICE\nSelecting processes\nBy default the\nkill\ncommand sends the signal\n              to\nall\nprocesses of the specified cgroup. You\n              can restrict it to the\ncontrol\nor the\nmain\nprocess. The latter is, for example, useful\n              to force a service to reload its configuration by sending\nSIGHUP\n:\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl kill -s SIGHUP --kill-who=main\nMY_SERVICE\n19.6.8\nImportant notes on the D-Bus service\n#\nThe D-Bus service is the message bus for communication between\nsystemd\nclients and the systemd manager that is running as pid 1.\n        Even though\ndbus\nis a\n        stand-alone daemon, it is an integral part of the init infrastructure.\nStopping\ndbus\nor restarting it\n        in the running system is similar to an attempt to stop or restart PID\n        1. It breaks the\nsystemd\nclient/server communication and makes most\nsystemd\nfunctions unusable.\nTherefore, terminating or restarting\ndbus\nis neither\n        recommended nor supported.\nUpdating the\ndbus\nor\ndbus\n-related packages requires a reboot. When\n        in doubt whether a reboot is necessary, run the\nsudo zypper ps\n        -s\n. If\ndbus\nappears among the listed\n        services, you need to reboot the system.\nKeep in mind that\ndbus\nis updated even when\n        automatic updates are configured to skip the packages that require\n        reboot.\n19.6.9\nDebugging services\n#\nBy default,\nsystemd\nis not overly verbose. If a service was started\n        successfully, no output is produced. In case of a failure, a short\n        error message is displayed. However,\nsystemctl\n        status\nprovides a means to debug the start-up and operation of a\n        service.\nsystemd\ncomes with its own logging mechanism (\n“\nThe\n        Journal\n”\n) that logs system messages. This allows you to display\n        the service messages together with status messages. The\nstatus\ncommand works similar to\ntail\nand can also display the log messages in\n        different formats, making it a powerful debugging tool.\nShow service start-up failure\nWhenever a service fails to start, use\nsystemctl status\nMY_SERVICE\nto get a detailed\n              error message:\n#\nsystemctl start apache2\nJob failed. See system journal and 'systemctl status' for details.\n#\nsystemctl status apache2\n   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/apache2.service; disabled)\n   Active: failed (Result: exit-code) since Mon, 04 Apr 2018 16:52:26 +0200; 29s ago\n   Process: 3088 ExecStart=/usr/sbin/start_apache2 -D SYSTEMD -k start (code=exited, status=1/FAILURE)\n   CGroup: name=systemd:/system/apache2.service\n\nApr 04 16:52:26 g144 start_apache2[3088]: httpd2-prefork: Syntax error on line\n205 of /etc/apache2/httpd.conf: Syntax error on li...alHost>\nShow last\nN\nservice messages\nThe default behavior of the\nstatus\nsubcommand is to display the last ten messages a service issued.\n       To change the number of messages to show, use the\n--lines=\nN\nparameter:\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl status chronyd\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl --lines=20 status chronyd\nShow service messages in append mode\nTo display a\n“\nlive stream\n”\nof service messages, use the\n--follow\noption, which works like\ntail\n-f\n:\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl --follow status chronyd\nMessages output format\nThe\n--output=\nMODE\nparameter allows you to change the output format of service messages.\n       The most important modes available are:\nshort\nThe default format.\n          Shows the log messages with a human readable time stamp.\nverbose\nFull output with all fields.\ncat\nTerse output without time stamps.\n19.7\nsystemd\ntimer units\n#\nSimilar to cron,\nsystemd\ntimer units provide a mechanism for scheduling jobs on Linux.\n   Although\nsystemd\ntimer units serve the same purpose as cron, they offer several advantages.\nJobs scheduled using a timer unit can depend on other\nsystemd\nservices.\nTimer units are treated as regular\nsystemd\nservices, so can be managed with\nsystemctl\n.\nTimers can be realtime and monotonic.\nTime units are logged to the\nsystemd\njournal, which makes it easier to monitor and troubleshoot them.\nsystemd\ntimer units are identified by the\n.timer\nfile name extension.\n19.7.1\nsystemd\ntimer types\n#\nTimer units can use monotonic and realtime timers.\nSimilar to cronjobs, realtime timers are triggered on calendar events.\n      Realtime timers are defined using the option\nOnCalendar\n.\nMonotonic timers are triggered at a specified time elapsed from a certain starting point.\n      The latter could be a system boot or system unit activation event.\n      There are several options for defining monotonic timers including\nOnBootSec\n,\nOnUnitActiveSec\n, and\nOnTypeSec\n.\n      Monotonic timers are not persistent, and they are reset after each reboot.\n19.7.2\nsystemd\ntimers and service units\n#\nEvery timer unit must have a corresponding\nsystemd\nunit file it controls.\n    In other words, a\n.timer\nfile activates and manages the corresponding\n.service\nfile.\n    When used with a timer, the\n.service\nfile does not require an\n[Install]\nsection, as the service is managed by the timer.\n19.7.3\nPractical example\n#\nTo understand the basics of\nsystemd\ntimer units, we set up a timer that triggers the\nfoo.sh\nshell script.\nFirst step is to create a\nsystemd\nservice unit that controls the shell script.\n    To do this, open a new text file for editing and add the following service unit definition:\n[Unit]\nDescription=\"Foo shell script\"\n\n[Service]\nExecStart=/usr/local/bin/foo.sh\nSave the file under the name\nfoo.service\nin the directory\n/etc/systemd/system/\n.\nNext, open a new text file for editing and add the following timer definition:\n[Unit]\nDescription=\"Run foo shell script\"\n\n[Timer]\nOnBootSec=5min\nOnUnitActiveSec=24h\nUnit=foo.service\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\nThe\n[Timer]\nsection in the example above specifies\n        what service to trigger (\nfoo.service\n) and when to\n        trigger it. In this case, the option\nOnBootSec\nspecifies a monotonic timer that triggers the service five minutes\n        after the system boot, while the option\nOnUnitActiveSec\ntriggers the service 24 hours after\n        the service has been activated (that is, the timer triggers the service\n        once a day). Finally, the option\nWantedBy\nspecifies\n        that the timer should start when the system has reached the multi-user\n        target.\nInstead of a monotonic timer, you can specify a real-time one using the\n        option\nOnCalendar\n. The following realtime timer\n        definition triggers the related service unit once a week, starting on\n        Monday at 12:00.\n[Timer]\nOnCalendar=weekly\nPersistent=true\nThe option\nPersistent=true\nindicates that the service\n        is triggered immediately after the timer activation if the timer missed\n        the last start time (for example, because of the system being powered\n        off).\nThe option\nOnCalendar\ncan also be used to define\n        specific dates times for triggering a service using the following\n        format:\nDayOfWeek Year-Month-Day Hour:Minute:Second\n.\n        The example below triggers a service at 5am every day:\nOnCalendar=*-*-* 5:00:00\nYou can use an asterisk to specify any value, and commas to list possible values.\n    Use two values separated by .. to indicate a contiguous range.\n    The following example triggers a service at 6pm on Friday of every month:\nOnCalendar=Fri *-*-1..7 18:00:00\nTo trigger a service at different times, you can specify several\nOnCalendar\nentries:\nOnCalendar=Mon..Fri 10:00\nOnCalendar=Sat,Sun 22:00\nIn the example above, a service is triggered at 10am on week days and at 10pm on weekends.\nWhen you are done editing the timer unit file, save it under the name\nfoo.timer\nin the\n/etc/systemd/system/\ndirectory.\n    To check the correctness of the created unit files, run the following command:\n>\nsudo\nsystemd-analyze verify /etc/systemd/system/foo.*\nIf the command returns no output, the files have passed the verification successfully.\nTo start the timer, use the command\nsudo systemctl start foo.timer\n.\n    To enable the timer on boot, run the command\nsudo systemctl enable foo.timer\n.\n19.7.4\nManaging\nsystemd\ntimers\n#\nSince timers are treated as regular\nsystemd\nunits, you can manage them using\nsystemctl\n.\n    You can start a timer with\nsystemctl start\n, enable a timer with\nsystemctl enable\n, and so on.\n    In addition to that, you can list all active timers using the command\nsystemctl list-timers\n.\n    To list all timers, including inactive ones, run the command\nsystemctl list-timers --all\n.\n19.8\nMore information\n#\nFor more information on\nsystemd\nrefer to the following online resources:\nHomepage\nhttp://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd\nsystemd\nfor administrators\nLennart Pöttering, one of the\nsystemd\nauthors, has written a series of blog entries (13 at the time of writing this chapter).\n      Find them at\nhttp://0pointer.de/blog/projects\n.\nOn this page\n19.1\nThe\nsystemd\nconcept\n19.2\nBasic usage\n19.3\nSystem start and target management\n19.4\nManaging services with YaST\n19.5\nCustomizing\nsystemd\n19.6\nAdvanced usage\n19.7\nsystemd\ntimer units\n19.8\nMore information\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

The developers have not ported all 32-bit applications to 64-bit\n  systems. This chapter offers a brief overview of 32-bit support implementation\n  on 64-bit\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nplatforms.\n21\njournalctl\n: Query the\nsystemd\njournal\nsystemd\nfeatures its own logging system called\njournal\n. There is no need to run a\nsyslog\n-based service, as all system events are\n  written to the journal.\n22\nupdate-alternatives\n: Managing multiple versions of commands and files\nOften, there are several versions of the same tool installed on a\n    system.\n    To give administrators a choice and to make it possible to install and\n    use different versions side by side, the alternatives system allows\n    managing such versions consistently.\n23\nBasic networking\nLinux offers the necessary networking tools and features for integration\n    into all types of network structures. Network access using a network card\n    can be configured with YaST. Manual configuration is also possible. In\n    this chapter, only the fundamental mechanisms and the relevant network\n    configuration files are covered.\n24\nPrinter operation\nSUSE® Linux Enterprise Server supports printing with many types of printers, including remote network printers. Printers can be configured manually or with YaST. For configuration instructions, refer to Chapter 34, Setting up a printer. Both graphical and command line utilities are available for sta…\n25\nGraphical user interface\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nincludes the X.org server and the GNOME desktop. This chapter describes the\n    configuration of the graphical user interface for all users.\n26\nAccessing file systems with FUSE\nFUSE is the acronym for\nFilesystem in Userspace\n.\n    This means you can configure and mount a file system as an unprivileged\n    user. Normally, you need to be\nroot\nfor this task. FUSE alone is\n    a kernel module. Combined with plug-ins, it allows you to extend FUSE to\n    access almost all file systems like remote SSH connections, ISO images, and\n    more.\n27\nInstalling multiple kernel versions\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nsupports the parallel installation of multiple kernel\n    versions. When installing a second kernel, a boot entry and an initrd are\n    automatically created, so no further manual configuration is needed. When\n    rebooting the machine, the newly added kernel is available as an additional\n    boot parameter.\nUsing this functionality, you can safely test kernel updates while being\n    able to always fall back to the proven former kernel. To do this, do not use\n    the update tools (such as the YaST Online Update or the updater applet),\n    but instead follow the process described in this chapter.\n28\nManaging kernel modules\nAlthough Linux is a monolithic kernel, it can be extended using kernel modules. These are special objects that can be inserted into the kernel and removed on demand. In practical terms, kernel modules make it possible to add and remove drivers and interfaces that are not included in the kernel itsel…\n29\nDynamic kernel device management with\nudev\nThe kernel can add or remove almost any device in a running system. Changes in the device state (whether a device is plugged in or removed) need to be propagated to user space. Devices need to be configured when they are plugged in and recognized. Users of a certain device need to be informed about …\n30\nSpecial system features\nThis chapter starts with information about various software packages, the\n    virtual consoles and the keyboard layout. We talk about software components\n    like\nbash\n,\ncron\nand\nlogrotate\n, because they were\n    changed or enhanced during the last release cycles. Even if they are small\n    or considered of minor importance, users should change their default\n    behavior, because these components are often closely coupled with the\n    system. The chapter concludes with a section about language and\n    country-specific settings (I18N and L10N).\n31\nUsing NetworkManager\nNetworkManager is the ideal solution for laptops and other portable computers. It supports state-of-the-art encryption types and standards for network connections, including connections to 802.1X protected networks. 802.1X is the “IEEE Standard for Local and Metropolitan Area Networks—Port-Based Net…\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

The developers have not ported all 32-bit applications to 64-bit\n  systems. This chapter offers a brief overview of 32-bit support implementation\n  on 64-bit\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nplatforms.\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nfor the 64-bit platforms POWER, IBM Z and\n  AMD64/Intel 64\nis designed so that existing\n  32-bit applications run in the 64-bit environment\n“\nout-of-the-box.\n”\nThe corresponding 32-bit\n  platforms are POWER for POWER, and x86 for AMD64/Intel 64.\nThis\n  support means that you can continue to use your preferred 32-bit applications\n  without waiting for a corresponding 64-bit port to become\n  available.\nThe current POWER system runs most\n  applications in 32-bit mode, but you can run 64-bit applications.\nNote: No support for building 32-bit applications\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\ndoes not support compilation of 32-bit applications. It only offers\n   runtime support for 32-bit binaries.\n20.1\nRuntime support\n#\nImportant: Conflicts between application versions\nIf an application is available for both 32-bit and 64-bit environments,\n    installing both versions may cause problems. In such cases, decide on one version\n    to install to avoid potential runtime errors.\nAn exception to this rule is PAM (pluggable authentication modules).\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nuses PAM in the authentication process as a layer that\n    mediates between user and application. Always install both PAM versions\n    on 64-bit operating systems that also run 32-bit applications.\nFor correct execution, every application requires a range of libraries.\n   Unfortunately, the names are identical for the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of these\n   libraries. They must be differentiated from each other in\n   another way.\nTo retain compatibility with 32-bit versions, 64-bit and\n   32-bit libraries are stored in the same location. The 32-bit\n   version of\nlibc.so.6\nis located under\n/lib/libc.so.6\nin both 32-bit and 64-bit\n   environments.\nAll 64-bit libraries and object files are located in directories called\nlib64\n. The 64-bit object files normally\n   found under\n/lib\nand\n/usr/lib\nare now found under\n/lib64\nand\n/usr/lib64\n. This means\n   that space is available for 32-bit libraries under\n/lib\nand\n/usr/lib\n, so the file name for both versions can\n   remain unchanged.\nIf the data content of 32-bit subdirectories under\n/lib\ndoes not\n   depend on word size, they are not moved. This scheme conforms to LSB (Linux Standards Base)\n   and FHS (File System Hierarchy Standard).\n20.2\nKernel specifications\n#\nThe 64-bit kernels for AMD64/Intel 64\n, POWER and\n   IBM Z\noffer both a 64-bit and a 32-bit kernel ABI (application\n   binary interface). The latter is identical to the ABI for the\n   corresponding 32-bit kernel. This means that communication between\n   both 32-bit and 64-bit applications with 64-bit kernels are identical.\nThe 32-bit system call emulation for 64-bit kernels does not support\n   all the APIs used by system programs. This depends on the platform. For this\n   reason, few applications, like\nlspci\n, must be\n   compiled\non non-POWER platforms as 64-bit programs to\n   function properly. On IBM Z, not all ioctls are available in the\n   32-bit kernel ABI\n.\nA 64-bit kernel can only load 64-bit kernel modules. You must\n   compile 64-bit modules specifically for 64-bit kernels. It is not possible to use 32-bit kernel modules\n   with 64-bit kernels.\nTip: Kernel-loadable modules\nSome applications require separate kernel-loadable modules. If you intend\n    to use a 32-bit application in a 64-bit system environment, contact\n    the provider of the application and SUSE. Make sure that the 64-bit\n    version of the kernel-loadable module and the 32-bit compiled version of\n    the kernel API are available for this module.\nOn this page\n20.1\nRuntime support\n20.2\nKernel specifications\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

There is no need to run a\nsyslog\n-based service, as all system events are\n  written to the journal.\nThe journal itself is a system service managed by\nsystemd\n. Its full name is\nsystemd-journald.service\n. It collects and stores logging\n  data by maintaining structured indexed journals based on logging information\n  received from the kernel, user processes, standard input, and system service errors. The\nsystemd-journald\nservice is on\n  by default:\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl status systemd-journald\nsystemd-journald.service - Journal Service\n   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/systemd-journald.service; static)\n   Active: active (running) since Mon 2014-05-26 08:36:59 EDT; 3 days ago\n     Docs: man:systemd-journald.service(8)\n           man:journald.conf(5)\n Main PID: 413 (systemd-journal)\n   Status: \"Processing requests...\"\n   CGroup: /system.slice/systemd-journald.service\n           └─413 /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-journald\n[...]\n21.1\nMaking the journal persistent\n#\nThe journal stores log data in\n/run/log/journal/\nby\n   default. Because the\n/run/\ndirectory is volatile by\n   nature, log data is lost at reboot. To make the log data persistent, create the\n   directory\n/var/log/journal/\nand make sure it\n   has the correct access modes and ownership, so the systemd-journald service can store its\n   data. To switch to persistent logging, execute the following commands:\n>\nsudo\nmkdir /var/log/journal\n>\nsudo\nsystemd-tmpfiles --create --prefix=/var/log/journal\n>\nsudo\njournalctl --flush\nAny log data stored in\n/run/log/journal/\nwill be flushed into\n/var/log/journal/\n.\n21.2\njournalctl\n: Useful switches\n#\nThis section introduces several common useful options to enhance the default\njournalctl\nbehavior. All switches are described in the\njournalctl\nmanual page,\nman 1\n   journalctl\n.\nTip: Messages related to a specific executable\nTo show all journal messages related to a specific executable, specify the\n    full path to the executable:\n>\nsudo\njournalctl /usr/lib/systemd/systemd\n-f\nShows only the most recent journal messages, and prints new log entries\n      as they are added to the journal.\nPrints the messages and jumps to the end of the journal, so that the\n      latest entries are visible within the pager.\n-r\nPrints the messages of the journal in reverse order, so that the latest\n      entries are listed first.\n-k\nShows only kernel messages. This is equivalent to the field match\n_TRANSPORT=kernel\n(see\nSection 21.3.3, “Filtering based on fields”\n).\n-u\nShows only messages for the specified\nsystemd\nunit. This is equivalent\n      to the field match\n_SYSTEMD_UNIT=\nUNIT\n(see\nSection 21.3.3, “Filtering based on fields”\n).\n>\nsudo\njournalctl -u apache2\n[...]\nJun 03 10:07:11 pinkiepie systemd[1]: Starting The Apache Webserver...\nJun 03 10:07:12 pinkiepie systemd[1]: Started The Apache Webserver.\n21.3\nFiltering the journal output\n#\nWhen called without switches,\njournalctl\nshows the full\n   content of the journal, the oldest entries listed first. The output can be\n   filtered by specific switches and fields.\n21.3.1\nFiltering based on a boot number\n#\njournalctl\ncan filter messages based on a specific\n    system boot. To list all available boots, run\n>\nsudo\njournalctl --list-boots\n-1 097ed2cd99124a2391d2cffab1b566f0 Mon 2014-05-26 08:36:56 EDT—Fri 2014-05-30 05:33:44 EDT\n 0 156019a44a774a0bb0148a92df4af81b Fri 2014-05-30 05:34:09 EDT—Fri 2014-05-30 06:15:01 EDT\nThe first column lists the boot offset:\n0\nfor the\n    current boot,\n-1\nfor the previous one,\n-2\nfor the one prior to that, etc. The second column\n    contains the boot ID followed by the limiting time stamps of the specific\n    boot.\nShow all messages from the current boot:\n>\nsudo\njournalctl -b\nIf you need to see journal messages from the previous boot, add an offset\n    parameter. The following example outputs the previous boot messages:\n>\nsudo\njournalctl -b -1\nAnother way is to list boot messages based on the boot ID. For this\n    purpose, use the _BOOT_ID field:\n>\nsudo\njournalctl _BOOT_ID=156019a44a774a0bb0148a92df4af81b\n21.3.2\nFiltering based on time interval\n#\nYou can filter the output of\njournalctl\nby specifying\n    the starting and/or ending date. The date specification should be of the\n    format \"2014-06-30 9:17:16\". If the time part is omitted, midnight is\n    assumed. If seconds are omitted, \":00\" is assumed. If the date part is\n    omitted, the current day is assumed. Instead of numeric expression, you can\n    specify the keywords \"yesterday\", \"today\", or \"tomorrow\". They refer to\n    midnight of the day before the current day, of the current day, or of the\n    day after the current day. If you specify \"now\", it refers to the current\n    time. You can also specify relative times prefixed with\n-\nor\n+\n, referring to times before or\n    after the current time.\nShow only new messages since now, and update the output continuously:\n>\nsudo\njournalctl --since \"now\" -f\nShow all messages since last midnight till 3:20am:\n>\nsudo\njournalctl --since \"today\" --until \"3:20\"\n21.3.3\nFiltering based on fields\n#\nYou can filter the output of the journal by specific fields. The syntax of\n    a field to be matched is\nFIELD_NAME=MATCHED_VALUE\n, such\n    as\n_SYSTEMD_UNIT=httpd.service\n. You can specify multiple\n    matches in a single query to filter the output messages even more.

See 'systemctl status apache2' and 'journalctl -xn' for details.\nLet us see what the service's status says:\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl status apache2\napache2.service - The Apache Webserver\n   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/apache2.service; disabled)\n   Active: failed (Result: exit-code) since Tue 2014-06-03 11:08:13 CEST; 7min ago\n  Process: 11026 ExecStop=/usr/sbin/start_apache2 -D SYSTEMD -DFOREGROUND \\\n           -k graceful-stop (code=exited, status=1/FAILURE)\nThe ID of the process causing the failure is 11026.\nShow the verbose version of messages related to process ID 11026:\n>\nsudo\njournalctl -o verbose _PID=11026\n[...]\nMESSAGE=AH00526: Syntax error on line 6 of /etc/apache2/default-server.conf:\n[...]\nMESSAGE=Invalid command 'DocumenttRoot', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module\n[...]\nFix the typo inside\n/etc/apache2/default-server.conf\n,\n     start the apache2 service, and print its status:\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl start apache2 && systemctl status apache2\napache2.service - The Apache Webserver\n   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/apache2.service; disabled)\n   Active: active (running) since Tue 2014-06-03 11:26:24 CEST; 4ms ago\n  Process: 11026 ExecStop=/usr/sbin/start_apache2 -D SYSTEMD -DFOREGROUND\n           -k graceful-stop (code=exited, status=1/FAILURE)\n Main PID: 11263 (httpd2-prefork)\n   Status: \"Processing requests...\"\n   CGroup: /system.slice/apache2.service\n           ├─11263 /usr/sbin/httpd2-prefork -f /etc/apache2/httpd.conf -D [...]\n           ├─11280 /usr/sbin/httpd2-prefork -f /etc/apache2/httpd.conf -D [...]\n           ├─11281 /usr/sbin/httpd2-prefork -f /etc/apache2/httpd.conf -D [...]\n           ├─11282 /usr/sbin/httpd2-prefork -f /etc/apache2/httpd.conf -D [...]\n           ├─11283 /usr/sbin/httpd2-prefork -f /etc/apache2/httpd.conf -D [...]\n           └─11285 /usr/sbin/httpd2-prefork -f /etc/apache2/httpd.conf -D [...]\n21.5\nJournald configuration\n#\nThe behavior of the systemd-journald service can be adjusted by modifying\n/etc/systemd/journald.conf\n. This section introduces\n   only basic option settings. For a complete file description, see\nman 5 journald.conf\n. Note that you need to restart the\n   journal for the changes to take effect with\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl restart systemd-journald\n21.5.1\nChanging the journal size limit\n#\nIf the journal log data is saved to a persistent location (see\nSection 21.1, “Making the journal persistent”\n), it uses up to 10% of the file\n    system the\n/var/log/journal\nresides on. For example,\n    if\n/var/log/journal\nis located on a 30 GB\n/var\npartition, the journal may use up to 3 GB of the\n    disk space. To change this limit, change (and uncomment) the\nSystemMaxUse\noption:\nSystemMaxUse=50M\n21.5.2\nForwarding the journal to\n/dev/ttyX\n#\nYou can forward the journal to a terminal device to inform you about system\n    messages on a preferred terminal screen, for example\n/dev/tty12\n. Change the following journald options to\nForwardToConsole=yes\nTTYPath=/dev/tty12\n21.5.3\nForwarding the journal to syslog facility\n#\nJournald is backward compatible with traditional syslog implementations\n    such as\nrsyslog\n. Make sure the following is valid:\nrsyslog is installed.\n>\nsudo\nrpm -q rsyslog\nrsyslog-7.4.8-2.16.x86_64\nrsyslog service is enabled.\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl is-enabled rsyslog\nenabled\nForwarding to syslog is enabled in\n/etc/systemd/journald.conf\n.\nForwardToSyslog=yes\n21.6\nUsing YaST to filter the\nsystemd\njournal\n#\nFor an easy way of filtering the systemd journal (without dealing\n   with the journalctl syntax), you can use the YaST journal module. After\n   installing it with\nsudo zypper in yast2-journal\n, start it\n   from YaST by selecting\nSystem\n›\nSystemd Journal\n. Alternatively, start it\n   from command line by entering\nsudo yast2 journal\n.\nFigure 21.1:\nYaST systemd journal\n#\nThe module displays the log entries in a table. The search box on top allows\n   you to search for entries that contain certain characters, similar to using\ngrep\n. To filter the entries by date and time, unit, file,\n   or priority, click\nChange filters\nand set the respective\n   options.\n21.7\nViewing logs in GNOME\n#\nYou can view the journal with\nGNOME Logs\n.\n   Start it from the application menu. To view system log messages, it\n   needs to be run as root, for example with\nxdg-su\n   gnome-logs\n.

For example,\n    if Java 1.7 and Java 1.8 are both installed on the system, the alternatives system script\n    (\nupdate-alternatives\n) is called from inside the RPM package.\n    By default, the alternatives system will refer to version 1.8: Higher versions also have a\n    higher priority. However, the administrator can change the default and\n    can point the generic name to version 1.7.\nThe following terminology is used in this chapter:\nTerminology\n#\nAdministrative directory\nThe default\n/var/lib/rpm/alternatives\ndirectory contains information\n       about the current state of alternatives.\nAlternative\nThe name of a specific file in the file system, which can be made\n       accessible via a generic name using the alternatives system.\nAlternatives directory\nThe default\n/etc/alternatives\ndirectory containing symbolic links.\nGeneric name\nA name (for example,\n/usr/bin/edit\n) that refers to\n       one file out of several available using the alternatives system.\nLink group\nA set of related symbolic links that can be updated as a group.\nMaster link\nThe link in a link group that determines how the other links in the\n       group are configured.\nSlave link\nA link in a link group controlled by the master link.\nSymbolic link (symlink)\nA file that is a reference to another file in the same file system.\n       The alternatives system uses symbolic links in the alternatives directory to switch\n       between versions of a file.\nSymbolic links in the alternatives directory can be modified by the\n       administrator through the\nupdate-alternatives\ncommand.\nThe alternatives system provides the\nupdate-alternatives\ncommand to\n    create, remove, maintain, and show information about symbolic links.\n    While these symbolic links usually point to commands, they can also point\n    to JAR archives, man pages, and other files.\n    Examples in this chapter use commands and man pages, but they are also\n    applicable to other file types.\nThe alternatives system uses the alternatives directory to collect links to possible\n    alternatives. When a new package with an alternative is installed,\n    the new alternative is added to the system. Whether the new package's\n    alternative is selected as the default depends on its priority and on the\n    mode that is set. Usually, packages\n    with a higher version also have a higher priority. The alternatives system can operate\n    in two modes:\nAutomatic mode.\nIn this mode, the alternatives system ensures that the links in the group point to\n       the highest priority alternatives appropriate for the group.\nManual mode.\nIn this mode, the alternatives system does not make any changes to the system\n       administrator's settings.\nFor example, the\njava\ncommand has the following link\n    hierarchy in the alternatives system:\nExample 22.1:\nAlternatives System of the\njava\ncommand\n#\n/usr/bin/java\n1\n-> /etc/alternatives/java\n2\n-> /usr/lib64/jvm/jre-10-openjdk/bin/java\n3\n1\nThe generic name.\n2\nThe symbolic link in the alternatives directory.\n3\nOne of the alternatives.\n22.2\nUse cases\n#\nBy default, the\nupdate-alternatives\nscript is called\n    from inside an RPM package. When a package is installed or removed, the\n    script takes care of all its symbolic links.\n    But you can run it manually from the command line for:\ndisplaying the current alternatives for a generic name.\nchanging the defaults of an alternative.\ncreating a set of related files for an alternative.\n22.3\nGetting an overview of alternatives\n#\nTo retrieve the names of all configured alternatives, use:\n>\nls /var/lib/alternatives\nTo get an overview of all configured alternatives and their values, use\n>\nsudo\nupdate-alternatives --get-selections\nasadmin                        auto     /usr/bin/asadmin-2.7\nawk                            auto     /usr/bin/gawk\nchardetect                     auto     /usr/bin/chardetect-3.6\ndbus-launch                    auto     /usr/bin/dbus-launch.x11\ndefault-displaymanager         auto     /usr/lib/X11/displaymanagers/gdm\n[...]\n22.4\nViewing details on specific alternatives\n#\nThe easiest way to check the alternatives is to follow the symbolic links of\n    your command.\n    For example, if you want to know what the\njava\ncommand is referring to, use the following command:\n>\nreadlink --canonicalize /usr/bin/java\n/usr/lib64/jvm/jre-10-openjdk/bin/java\nIf you see the same path (in our example, it is\n/usr/bin/java\n),\n    there are no alternatives available for this command.\nTo see the full alternatives (including slaves), use the\n--display\noption:\n>\nsudo\nupdate-alternatives --display java\njava - auto mode\n  link best version is /usr/lib64/jvm/jre-1.8.0-openjdk/bin/java\n  link currently points to /usr/lib64/jvm/jre-1.8.0-openjdk/bin/java\n  link java is /usr/bin/java\n  slave java.1.gz is /usr/share/man/man1/java.1.gz\n  slave jre is /usr/lib64/jvm/jre\n  slave jre_exports is /usr/lib64/jvm-exports/jre\n  slave keytool is /usr/bin/keytool\n  slave keytool.1.gz is /usr/share/man/man1/keytool.1.gz\n  slave orbd is /usr/bin/orbd\n  slave orbd.1.gz is /usr/share/man/man1/orbd.1.gz\n[...]\n22.5\nSetting the default version of alternatives\n#\nBy default, commands in\n/usr/bin\nrefer to the\n    alternatives directory with the highest priority. For example,\n    by default, the command\njava\nshows the following\n    version number:\n>\njava -version\nopenjdk version \"10.0.1\" 2018-04-17\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 10.0.1+10-suse-lp150.1.11-x8664)\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 10.0.1+10-suse-lp150.1.11-x8664, mixed mode)\nTo change the default\njava\ncommand to refer\n    to a previous version, run:\n>\nsudo\nupdate-alternatives --config java\nroot's password:\nThere are 2 choices for the alternative java (providing /usr/bin/java).\n\n  Selection    Path                                       Priority   Status\n------------------------------------------------------------\n* 0            /usr/lib64/jvm/jre-10-openjdk/bin/java      2005      auto mode\n  1            /usr/lib64/jvm/jre-1.8.0-openjdk/bin/java   1805      manual mode\n  2            /usr/lib64/jvm/jre-10-openjdk/bin/java      2005      manual mode\n  3            /usr/lib64/jvm/jre-11-openjdk/bin/java      0         manual mode\n\nPress <enter> to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number:\nDepending on your system and installed versions, the exact Java version\n    number will be different.\n    After you have selected\n1\n,\njava\nshows the following version number:\n>\njava -version\njava version \"1.8.0_171\"\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea 3.8.0) (build 1.8.0_171-b11 suse-lp150.2.3.1-x86_64)\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.171-b11, mixed mode)\nAlso, keep in mind the following points:\nWhen working in manual mode and installing another Java\n      version, the alternatives system neither touches the links nor changes the\n      generic name.\nWhen working in automatic mode and installing another Java version,\n      the alternatives system changes the Java master link and all slave links (as you can\n      see in\nSection 22.4, “Viewing details on specific alternatives”\n).\n      To check the master-slave relationships, use:\n>\nsudo\nupdate-alternatives --display java\n22.6\nInstalling custom alternatives\n#\nThis section describes how to set up custom alternatives on a system.\nWarning: No custom alternatives for python3\nDo not install custom alternatives for python3.\n/usr/bin/python3\ndoes not have update alternatives and\n       always points to specific tested versions. Creating a custom python3\n       alternative pointing to a different version—such as python\n       3.11—breaks dependent system tools.\nThe example makes the following assumptions:\nThere are two scripts,\nfoo-2\nand\nfoo-3\n,\n      with similar functionality.\nThe scripts are stored in the\n/usr/local/bin\ndirectory to avoid any conflicts with the system tools in\n/usr/bin\n.\nThere is a master link\nfoo\nthat points to either\nfoo-2\nor\nfoo-3\n.\nTo provide alternatives on your system, follow these steps:\nCopy your scripts into the\n/usr/local/bin\ndirectory.\nMake the scripts executable:\n>\nsudo\nchmod +x /usr/local/bin/foo-{2,3}\nRun\nupdate-alternatives\nfor both scripts:\n>\nsudo\nupdate-alternatives --install \\\n   /usr/local/bin/foo\n1\n\\\n   foo\n2\n\\\n   /usr/local/bin/foo-2\n3\n\\\n   200\n4\n>\nsudo\nupdate-alternatives --install \\\n   /usr/local/bin/foo\n1\n\\\n   foo\n2\n\\\n   /usr/local/bin/foo-3\n3\n\\\n   300\n4\nThe options after\n--install\nhave the following meanings:\n1\nThe generic name. To avoid confusion, this is usually the script\n        name without any version numbers.\n2\nThe name of the master link. Must be the same.\n3\nThe path to the original script(s) located in\n/usr/local/bin\n.\n4\nThe priority.\n        We give\nfoo-2\na lower priority than\nfoo-3\n.\n        It is good practice to use a significant number increase to separate\n        priorities. For example, a priority of 200 for\nfoo-2\nand 300 for\nfoo-3\n.\nCheck the master link:\n>\nsudo\nupdate-alternatives --display foo\nfoo - auto mode\n  link best version is /usr/local/bin/foo-3\n  link currently points to /usr/local/bin/foo-3\n  link foo is /usr/local/bin/foo\n/usr/local/bin/foo-2 - priority 200\n/usr/local/bin/foo-3 - priority 300\nAfter you completed the described steps, you can use the master link\n/usr/local/bin/foo\n.\nIf needed, you can install additional alternatives.\n    To remove an alternative, use the following command:\n>\nsudo\nupdate-alternatives --remove foo /usr/local/bin/foo-2\nAfter this script has been removed, the alternatives system for the foo group looks\n    like this:\n>\nsudo\nupdate-alternatives --display foo\nfoo - auto mode\n  link best version is /usr/local/bin/foo-3\n  link currently points to /usr/local/bin/foo-3\n  link foo is /usr/local/bin/foo\n/usr/local/bin/foo-3 - priority 300\n22.7\nDefining dependent alternatives\n#\nIf you have alternatives, the script itself is not enough. Most commands\n    are not completely stand-alone: They usually ship with additional files,\n    such as extensions, configurations, or man pages.\n    To create alternatives which are dependent on a master\n    link, use\nslave alternatives\n.\nLet us assume we want to extend our example in\nSection 22.6, “Installing custom alternatives”\nand provide man pages and configuration files:\nTwo man pages,\nfoo-2.1.gz\nand\nfoo-3.1.gz\nstored in the\n/usr/local/man/man1\ndirectory.\nTwo configuration files,\nfoo-2.conf\nand\nfoo-3.conf\n, stored in\n/etc\n.\nFollow these steps to add the additional files to your alternatives:\nCopy the configuration files into\n/etc\n:\n>\nsudo\ncp foo-{2,3}.conf /etc\nCopy the man pages into the\n/usr/local/man/man1\ndirectory:\n>\nsudo\ncp foo-{2,3}.1.gz /usr/local/man/man1/\nAdd the slave links to the main scripts with the\n--slave\noption:\n>\nsudo\nupdate-alternatives --install \\\n   /usr/local/bin/foo foo /usr/local/bin/foo-2 200 \\\n   --slave /usr/local/man/man1/foo.1.gz \\\n   foo.1.gz \\\n   /usr/local/man/man1/foo-2.1.gz \\\n   --slave /etc/foo.conf \\\n   foo.conf \\\n   /etc/foo-2.conf\n>\nsudo\nupdate-alternatives --install \\\n   /usr/local/bin/foo foo /usr/local/bin/foo-3 300 \\\n   --slave /usr/local/man/man1/foo.1.gz \\\n   foo.1.gz \\\n   /usr/local/man/man1/foo-3.1.gz \\\n   --slave /etc/foo.conf \\\n   foo.conf \\\n   /etc/foo-3.conf\nCheck the master link:\nfoo - auto mode\n  link best version is /usr/local/bin/foo-3\n  link currently points to /usr/local/bin/foo-3\n  link foo is /usr/local/bin/foo\n  slave foo.1.gz is /usr/local/man/man1/foo.1.gz\n  slave foo.conf is /etc/foo.conf\n/usr/local/bin/foo-2 - priority 200\n  slave foo.1.gz: /usr/local/man/man1/foo-2.1.gz\n  slave foo.conf: /etc/foo-2.conf\n/usr/local/bin/foo-3 - priority 300\n  slave foo.1.gz: /usr/local/man/man1/foo-3.1.gz\n  slave foo.conf: /etc/foo-3.conf\nIf you change the links with\nupdate-alternatives --config foo\nto\nfoo-2\n, then all slave links will change as well.\nOn this page\n22.1\nOverview\n22.2\nUse cases\n22.3\nGetting an overview of alternatives\n22.4\nViewing details on specific alternatives\n22.5\nSetting the default version of alternatives\n22.6\nInstalling custom alternatives\n22.7\nDefining dependent alternatives\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

Network access using a network card\n    can be configured with YaST. Manual configuration is also possible. In\n    this chapter, only the fundamental mechanisms and the relevant network\n    configuration files are covered.\nLinux and other Unix operating systems use the TCP/IP protocol. It is not a\n  single network protocol, but a family of network protocols that offer various\n  services. The protocols listed in\nSeveral protocols in the TCP/IP protocol family\nare provided for exchanging data between two machines via TCP/IP. Networks\n  combined by TCP/IP, comprising a worldwide network, are also called\n“\nthe Internet.\n”\nRFC stands for\nRequest for Comments\n. RFCs are documents\n  that describe various Internet protocols and implementation procedures for\n  the operating system and its applications. The RFC documents describe the\n  setup of Internet protocols. For more information about RFCs, see\nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/\n.\nSeveral protocols in the TCP/IP protocol family\n#\nTCP\nTransmission Control Protocol: a connection-oriented secure protocol. The\n     data to transmit is first sent by the application as a stream of data and\n     converted into the appropriate format by the operating system. The data\n     arrives at the respective application on the destination host in the\n     original data stream format it was initially sent. TCP determines whether\n     any data has been lost or jumbled during the transmission. TCP is\n     implemented wherever the data sequence matters.\nUDP\nUser Datagram Protocol: a connectionless, insecure protocol. The data to\n     transmit is sent in the form of packets generated by the application. The\n     order in which the data arrives at the recipient is not guaranteed and\n     data loss is possible. UDP is suitable for record-oriented applications.\n     It features a smaller latency period than TCP.\nICMP\nInternet Control Message Protocol: This is not a protocol for the end\n     user, but a special control protocol that issues error reports and can\n     control the behavior of machines participating in TCP/IP data transfer. In\n     addition, it provides a special echo mode that can be viewed using the\n     program ping.\nIGMP\nInternet Group Management Protocol: This protocol controls machine\n     behavior when implementing IP multicast.\nAs shown in\nFigure 23.1, “Simplified layer model for TCP/IP”\n, data exchange takes place in\n  different layers. The actual network layer is the insecure data transfer via\n  IP (Internet protocol). On top of IP, TCP (transmission control protocol)\n  guarantees, to a certain extent, security of the data transfer. The IP layer\n  is supported by the underlying hardware-dependent protocol, such as Ethernet.\nFigure 23.1:\nSimplified layer model for TCP/IP\n#\nThe diagram provides one or two examples for each layer. The layers are\n  ordered according to\nabstraction levels\n. The lowest\n  layer is very close to the hardware. The uppermost layer, however, is almost\n  a complete abstraction from the hardware. Every layer has its own special\n  function. The special functions of each layer are mostly implicit in their\n  description. The data link and physical layers represent the physical network\n  used, such as Ethernet.\nAlmost all hardware protocols work on a packet-oriented basis. The data to\n  transmit is collected into\npackets\n(it cannot be sent\n  all at once). The maximum size of a TCP/IP packet is approximately 64 KB.\n  Packets are normally quite small, as the network hardware can be a limiting\n  factor. The maximum size of a data packet on Ethernet is about fifteen\n  hundred bytes. The size of a TCP/IP packet is limited to this amount when the\n  data is sent over Ethernet. If more data is transferred, more data packets\n  need to be sent by the operating system.\nFor the layers to serve their designated functions, additional information\n  regarding each layer must be saved in the data packet. This takes place in\n  the\nheader\nof the packet. Every layer attaches a small\n  block of data, called the protocol header, to the front of each emerging\n  packet. A sample TCP/IP data packet traveling over an Ethernet cable is\n  illustrated in\nFigure 23.2, “TCP/IP Ethernet packet”\n. The proof sum is\n  located at the end of the packet, not at the beginning. This simplifies\n  things for the network hardware.\nFigure 23.2:\nTCP/IP Ethernet packet\n#\nWhen an application sends data over the network, the data passes through each\n  layer, all implemented in the Linux kernel except the physical layer. Each\n  layer is responsible for preparing the data so it can be passed to the next\n  layer. The lowest layer is ultimately responsible for sending the data. The\n  entire procedure is reversed when data is received. Like the layers of an\n  onion, in each layer the protocol headers are removed from the transported\n  data. Finally, the transport layer is responsible for making the data\n  available for use by the applications at the destination. In this manner, one\n  layer only communicates with the layer directly above or below it. For\n  applications, it is irrelevant whether data is transmitted via a wireless or\n  wired connection. Likewise, it is irrelevant for the data line which kind of\n  data is transmitted, as long as packets are in the correct format.\n23.1\nIP addresses and routing\n#\nThe discussion in this section is limited to IPv4 networks. For information\n   about IPv6 protocol, the successor to IPv4, refer to\nSection 23.2, “IPv6—the next generation Internet”\n.\n23.1.1\nIP addresses\n#\nEvery computer on the Internet has a unique 32-bit address. These 32 bits\n    (or 4 bytes) are normally written as illustrated in the second row in\nExample 23.1, “Writing IP addresses”\n.\nExample 23.1:\nWriting IP addresses\n#\nIP Address (binary):  11000000 10101000 00000000 00010100\nIP Address (decimal):      192.     168.       0.      20\nIn decimal form, the four bytes are written in the decimal number system,\n    separated by periods. The IP address is assigned to a host or a network\n    interface. It can be used only once throughout the world. There are\n    exceptions to this rule, but these are not relevant to the following\n    passages.\nThe points in IP addresses indicate the hierarchical system. Until the\n    1990s, IP addresses were strictly categorized in classes. However, this\n    system proved too inflexible and was discontinued. Now,\nclassless\n    routing\n(CIDR, classless interdomain routing) is used.\n23.1.2\nNetmasks and routing\n#\nNetmasks are used to define the address range of a subnet. If two hosts are\n    in the same subnet, they can reach each other directly. If they are not in\n    the same subnet, they need the address of a gateway that handles all the\n    traffic for the subnet. To check if two IP addresses are in the same\n    subnet, simply\n“\nAND\n”\nboth addresses with the netmask. If the\n    result is identical, both IP addresses are in the same local network. If\n    there are differences, the remote IP address, and thus the remote\n    interface, can only be reached over a gateway.\nTo understand how the netmask works, look at\nExample 23.2, “Linking IP addresses to the netmask”\n. The netmask consists of 32 bits\n    that identify how much of an IP address belongs to the network. All those\n    bits that are\n1\nmark the corresponding bit in the IP\n    address as belonging to the network. All bits that are\n0\nmark bits inside the subnet. This means that the more bits are\n1\n, the smaller the subnet is. Because the netmask always\n    consists of several successive\n1\nbits, it is also\n    possible to count the number of bits in the netmask. In\nExample 23.2, “Linking IP addresses to the netmask”\nthe first net with 24 bits could\n    also be written as\n192.168.0.0/24\n.\nExample 23.2:\nLinking IP addresses to the netmask\n#\nIP address (192.168.0.20):  11000000 10101000 00000000 00010100\nNetmask   (255.255.255.0):  11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nResult of the link:         11000000 10101000 00000000 00000000\nIn the decimal system:           192.     168.       0.       0\n\nIP address (213.95.15.200): 11010101 10111111 00001111 11001000\nNetmask    (255.255.255.0): 11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nResult of the link:         11010101 10111111 00001111 00000000\nIn the decimal system:           213.      95.      15.       0\nTo give another example: all machines connected with the same Ethernet\n    cable are usually located in the same subnet and are directly accessible.\n    Even when the subnet is physically divided by switches or bridges, these\n    hosts can still be reached directly.\nIP addresses outside the local subnet can only be reached if a gateway is\n    configured for the target network. In the most common case, there is only\n    one gateway that handles all traffic that is external. However, it is also\n    possible to configure several gateways for different subnets.\nIf a gateway has been configured, all external IP packets are sent to the\n    appropriate gateway. This gateway then attempts to forward the packets in\n    the same manner—from host to host—until it reaches the\n    destination host or the packet's TTL (time to live) expires.\nSpecific addresses\n#\nBase Network Address\nThis is the netmask AND any address in the network, as shown in\nExample 23.2, “Linking IP addresses to the netmask”\nunder\nResult\n.\n       This address cannot be assigned to any hosts.\nBroadcast Address\nThis could be paraphrased as:\n“\nAccess all hosts in this\n       subnet.\n”\nTo generate this, the netmask is inverted in binary form\n       and linked to the base network address with a logical OR. The above\n       example therefore results in 192.168.0.255. This address cannot be\n       assigned to any hosts.\nLocal Host\nThe address\n127.0.0.1\nis\n       assigned to the\n“\nloopback device\n”\non each host. A\n       connection can be set up to your own machine with this address and with\n       all addresses from the complete\n127.0.0.0/8\nloopback network\n       as defined with IPv4. With IPv6 there is only one loopback address\n       (\n::1\n).\nBecause IP addresses must be unique all over the world, you cannot select\n    random addresses. There are three address domains to use if you want to set\n    up a private IP-based network. These cannot get any connection from the\n    rest of the Internet, because they cannot be transmitted over the Internet.\n    These address domains are specified in RFC 1597 and listed in\nTable 23.1, “Private IP address domains”\n.\nTable 23.1:\nPrivate IP address domains\n#\nNetwork/Netmask\nDomain\n10.0.0.0\n/\n255.0.0.0\n10.x.x.x\n172.16.0.0\n/\n255.240.0.0\n172.16.x.x\n–\n172.31.x.x\n192.168.0.0\n/\n255.255.0.0\n192.168.x.x\n23.2\nIPv6—the next generation Internet\n#\nImportant: IBM Z: IPv6 support\nIPv6 is not supported by the CTC and IUCV network connections of the\n    IBM Z hardware.\nBecause of the emergence of the World Wide Web (WWW), the Internet has\n   experienced explosive growth, with an increasing number of computers\n   communicating via TCP/IP in the past fifteen years. Since Tim Berners-Lee at\n   CERN (\nhttp://public.web.cern.ch\n) invented the WWW in\n   1990, the number of Internet hosts has grown from a few thousand to about a\n   hundred million.\nAs mentioned, an IPv4 address consists of only 32 bits. Also, quite a few IP\n   addresses are lost—they cannot be used because of the way in which\n   networks are organized. The number of addresses available in your subnet is\n   two to the power of the number of bits, minus two. A subnet has, for\n   example, 2, 6, or 14 addresses available. To connect 128 hosts to the\n   Internet, for example, you need a subnet with 256 IP addresses, from which\n   only 254 are usable, because two IP addresses are needed for the structure\n   of the subnet itself: the broadcast and the base network address.\nUnder the current IPv4 protocol, DHCP or NAT (network address translation)\n   are the typical mechanisms used to circumvent the potential address\n   shortage. Combined with the convention to keep private and public address\n   spaces separate, these methods can certainly mitigate the shortage. To set\n   up a host in an IPv4 network, you need several address items, such as the\n   host's own IP address, the subnetmask, the gateway address, and maybe a name\n   server address. All these items need to be known and cannot be derived from\n   somewhere else.\nWith IPv6, both the address shortage and the complicated configuration\n   should be a thing of the past. The following sections tell more about the\n   improvements and benefits brought by IPv6 and about the transition from the\n   old protocol to the new one.\n23.2.1\nAdvantages\n#\nThe most important and most visible improvement brought by the IPv6\n    protocol is the enormous expansion of the available address space. An IPv6\n    address is made up of 128 bit values instead of the traditional 32 bits.\n    This provides for as many as several quadrillion IP addresses.\nHowever, IPv6 addresses are not only different from their predecessors with\n    regard to their length. They also have a different internal structure that\n    may contain more specific information about the systems and the networks to\n    which they belong. More details about this are found in\nSection 23.2.2, “Address types and structure”\n.\nThe following is a list of other advantages of the IPv6 protocol:\nAutoconfiguration\nIPv6 makes the network\n“\nplug and play\n”\ncapable, which means\n       that a newly configured system integrates into the (local) network\n       without any manual configuration. The new host uses its automatic\n       configuration mechanism to derive its own address from the information\n       made available by the neighboring routers, relying on a protocol called\n       the\nneighbor discovery\n(ND) protocol. This method\n       does not require any intervention on the administrator's part and there\n       is no need to maintain a central server for address allocation—an\n       additional advantage over IPv4, where automatic address allocation\n       requires a DHCP server.\nNevertheless if a router is connected to a switch, the router should\n       send periodic advertisements with flags telling the hosts of a network\n       how they should interact with each other. For more information, see\n       RFC 2462 and the\nradvd.conf(5)\nman page, and\n       RFC 3315.\nMobility\nIPv6 makes it possible to assign several addresses to one network\n       interface at the same time. This allows users to access several networks\n       easily, something that could be compared with the international roaming\n       services offered by mobile phone companies. When you take your mobile\n       phone abroad, the phone automatically logs in to a foreign service when\n       it enters the corresponding area, so you can be reached under the same\n       number everywhere and can place an outgoing call, as you would in your\n       home area.\nSecure communication\nWith IPv4, network security is an add-on function. IPv6 includes IPsec\n       as one of its core features, allowing systems to communicate over a\n       secure tunnel to avoid eavesdropping by outsiders on the Internet.\nBackward compatibility\nRealistically, it would be impossible to switch the entire Internet from\n       IPv4 to IPv6 at one time. Therefore, it is crucial that both protocols\n       can coexist not only on the Internet, but also on one system. This is\n       ensured by compatible addresses (IPv4 addresses can easily be translated\n       into IPv6 addresses) and by using several tunnels. See\nSection 23.2.3, “Coexistence of IPv4 and IPv6”\n. Also, systems can rely on a\ndual stack IP\ntechnique to support both protocols\n       at the same time, meaning that they have two network stacks that are\n       completely separate, such that there is no interference between the two\n       protocol versions.\nCustom tailored services through multicasting\nWith IPv4, some services, such as SMB, need to broadcast their packets\n       to all hosts in the local network. IPv6 allows a much more fine-grained\n       approach by enabling servers to address hosts through\nmulticasting\n, that is by addressing several hosts\n       as parts of a group. This is different from addressing all hosts through\nbroadcasting\nor each host individually through\nunicasting\n. Which hosts are addressed as a group\n       may depend on the concrete application. There are some predefined groups\n       to address all name servers (the\nall name servers multicast\n       group\n), for example, or all routers (the\nall\n       routers multicast group\n).\n23.2.2\nAddress types and structure\n#\nAs mentioned, the current IP protocol has two major limitations: there is\n    an increasing shortage of IP addresses and configuring the network and\n    maintaining the routing tables is becoming a more complex and burdensome\n    task. IPv6 solves the first problem by expanding the address space to\n    128 bits. The second one is mitigated by introducing a hierarchical address\n    structure combined with sophisticated techniques to allocate network\n    addresses, and\nmultihoming\n(the ability to assign\n    several addresses to one device, giving access to several networks).\nWhen dealing with IPv6, it is useful to know about three different types of\n    addresses:\nUnicast\nAddresses of this type are associated with exactly one network\n       interface. Packets with such an address are delivered to only one\n       destination. Accordingly, unicast addresses are used to transfer packets\n       to individual hosts on the local network or the Internet.\nMulticast\nAddresses of this type relate to a group of network interfaces. Packets\n       with such an address are delivered to all destinations that belong to\n       the group. Multicast addresses are mainly used by certain network\n       services to communicate with certain groups of hosts in a well-directed\n       manner.\nAnycast\nAddresses of this type are related to a group of interfaces. Packets\n       with such an address are delivered to the member of the group that is\n       closest to the sender, according to the principles of the underlying\n       routing protocol. Anycast addresses are used to make it easier for hosts\n       to find out about servers offering certain services in the given network\n       area. All servers of the same type have the same anycast address.\n       Whenever a host requests a service, it receives a reply from the server\n       with the closest location, as determined by the routing protocol. If\n       this server should fail for some reason, the protocol automatically\n       selects the second closest server, then the third one, and so forth.\nAn IPv6 address is made up of eight four-digit fields, each representing 16\n    bits, written in hexadecimal notation. They are separated by colons\n    (\n:\n). Any leading zero bytes within a given field may be\n    dropped, but zeros within the field or at its end may not. Another\n    convention is that more than four consecutive zero bytes may be collapsed\n    into a double colon. However, only one such\n::\nis\n    allowed per address. This kind of shorthand notation is shown in\nExample 23.3, “Sample IPv6 address”\n, where all three lines represent the\n    same address.\nExample 23.3:\nSample IPv6 address\n#\nfe80 : 0000 : 0000 : 0000 : 0000 : 10 : 1000 : 1a4\nfe80 :    0 :    0 :    0 :    0 : 10 : 1000 : 1a4\nfe80 :                           : 10 : 1000 : 1a4\nEach part of an IPv6 address has a defined function. The first bytes form\n    the prefix and specify the type of address. The center part is the network\n    portion of the address, but it may be unused. The end of the address forms\n    the host part. With IPv6, the netmask is defined by indicating the length\n    of the prefix after a slash at the end of the address. An address, as shown\n    in\nExample 23.4, “IPv6 address specifying the prefix length”\n, contains the information that the\n    first 64 bits form the network part of the address and the last 64 form its\n    host part. In other words, the\n64\nmeans that the netmask\n    is filled with 64 1-bit values from the left. As with IPv4, the IP address\n    is combined with AND with the values from the netmask to determine whether\n    the host is located in the same subnet or in another one.\nExample 23.4:\nIPv6 address specifying the prefix length\n#\nfe80::10:1000:1a4/64\nIPv6 knows about several predefined types of prefixes. Some are shown in\nVarious IPv6 prefixes\n.\nVarious IPv6 prefixes\n#\n00\nIPv4 addresses and IPv4 over IPv6 compatibility addresses. These are\n       used to maintain compatibility with IPv4. Their use still requires a\n       router able to translate IPv6 packets into IPv4 packets. Several special\n       addresses, such as the one for the loopback device, have this prefix as\n       well.\n2\nor\n3\nas the first digit\nAggregatable global unicast addresses. As is the case with IPv4, an\n       interface can be assigned to form part of a certain subnet. Currently,\n       there are the following address spaces:\n2001::/16\n(production quality\n       address space) and\n2002::/16\n(6to4 address space).\nfe80::/10\nLink-local addresses. Addresses with this prefix should not be routed\n       and should therefore only be reachable from within the same subnet.\nfec0::/10\nSite-local addresses. These may be routed, but only within the network\n       of the organization to which they belong. In effect, they are the IPv6\n       equivalent of the current private network address space, such as\n10.x.x.x\n.\nff\nThese are multicast addresses.\nA unicast address consists of three basic components:\nPublic topology\nThe first part (which also contains one of the prefixes mentioned above)\n       is used to route packets through the public Internet. It includes\n       information about the company or institution that provides the Internet\n       access.\nSite topology\nThe second part contains routing information about the subnet to which\n       to deliver the packet.\nInterface ID\nThe third part identifies the interface to which to deliver the packet.\n       This also allows for the MAC to form part of the address. Given that the\n       MAC is a globally unique, fixed identifier coded into the device by the\n       hardware maker, the configuration procedure is substantially simplified.\n       In fact, the first 64 address bits are consolidated to form the\nEUI-64\ntoken, with the last 48 bits taken from the\n       MAC, and the remaining 24 bits containing special information about the\n       token type. This also makes it possible to assign an\nEUI-64\ntoken to interfaces that do not have a MAC,\n       such as those based on point-to-point protocol (PPP).\nOn top of this basic structure, IPv6 distinguishes between five different\n    types of unicast addresses:\n::\n(unspecified)\nThis address is used by the host as its source address when the\n       interface is initialized for the first time (at which point, the address\n       cannot yet be determined by other means).\n::1\n(loopback)\nThe address of the loopback device.\nIPv4 compatible addresses\nThe IPv6 address is formed by the IPv4 address and a prefix consisting\n       of 96 zero bits. This type of compatibility address is used for\n       tunneling (see\nSection 23.2.3, “Coexistence of IPv4 and IPv6”\n) to allow IPv4\n       and IPv6 hosts to communicate with others operating in a pure IPv4\n       environment.\nIPv4 addresses mapped to IPv6\nThis type of address specifies a pure IPv4 address in IPv6 notation.\nLocal addresses\nThere are two address types for local use:\nlink-local\nThis type of address can only be used in the local subnet. Packets\n          with a source or target address of this type should not be routed to\n          the Internet or other subnets. These addresses contain a special\n          prefix (\nfe80::/10\n) and the\n          interface ID of the network card, with the middle part consisting of\n          zero bytes. Addresses of this type are used during automatic\n          configuration to communicate with other hosts belonging to the same\n          subnet.\nsite-local\nPackets with this type of address may be routed to other subnets, but\n          not to the wider Internet—they must remain inside the\n          organization's own network. Such addresses are used for intranets and\n          are an equivalent of the private address space defined by IPv4. They\n          contain a special prefix\n          (\nfec0::/10\n), the interface\n          ID, and a 16-bit field specifying the subnet ID. Again, the rest is\n          filled with zero bytes.\nAs a completely new feature introduced with IPv6, each network interface\n    normally gets several IP addresses, with the advantage that several\n    networks can be accessed through the same interface. One of these networks\n    can be configured completely automatically using the MAC and a known prefix\n    with the result that all hosts on the local network can be reached when\n    IPv6 is enabled (using the link-local address). With the MAC forming part\n    of it, any IP address used in the world is unique. The only variable parts\n    of the address are those specifying the\nsite topology\nand the\npublic topology\n, depending on the actual\n    network in which the host is currently operating.\nFor a host to go back and forth between different networks, it needs at\n    least two addresses. One of them, the\nhome address\n,\n    not only contains the interface ID but also an identifier of the home\n    network to which it normally belongs (and the corresponding prefix). The\n    home address is a static address and, as such, it does not normally change.\n    Still, all packets destined to the mobile host can be delivered to it,\n    regardless of whether it operates in the home network or somewhere outside.\n    This is made possible by the completely new features introduced with IPv6,\n    such as\nstateless autoconfiguration\nand\nneighbor discovery\n. In addition to its home address, a\n    mobile host gets one or more additional addresses that belong to the\n    foreign networks where it is roaming. These are called\ncare-of\naddresses. The home network has a facility\n    that forwards any packets destined to the host when it is roaming outside.\n    In an IPv6 environment, this task is performed by the\nhome\n    agent\n, which takes all packets destined to the home address and\n    relays them through a tunnel. On the other hand, those packets destined to\n    the care-of address are directly transferred to the mobile host without any\n    special detours.\n23.2.3\nCoexistence of IPv4 and IPv6\n#\nThe migration of all hosts connected to the Internet from IPv4 to IPv6 is a\n    gradual process. Both protocols will coexist for some time to come. The\n    coexistence on one system is guaranteed where there is a\ndual\n    stack\nimplementation of both protocols. That still leaves the\n    question of how an IPv6 enabled host should communicate with an IPv4 host\n    and how IPv6 packets should be transported by the current networks, which\n    are predominantly IPv4-based. The best solutions offer tunneling and\n    compatibility addresses (see\nSection 23.2.2, “Address types and structure”\n).\nIPv6 hosts that are more or less isolated in the (worldwide) IPv4 network\n    can communicate through tunnels: IPv6 packets are encapsulated as IPv4\n    packets to move them across an IPv4 network. Such a connection between two\n    IPv4 hosts is called a\ntunnel\n. To achieve this,\n    packets must include the IPv6 destination address (or the corresponding\n    prefix) and the IPv4 address of the remote host at the receiving end of the\n    tunnel. A basic tunnel can be configured manually according to an agreement\n    between the hosts' administrators. This is also called\nstatic\n    tunneling\n.\nHowever, the configuration and maintenance of static tunnels is often too\n    labor-intensive to use them for daily communication needs. Therefore, IPv6\n    provides for three different methods of\ndynamic\n    tunneling\n:\n6over4\nIPv6 packets are automatically encapsulated as IPv4 packets and sent\n       over an IPv4 network capable of multicasting. IPv6 is tricked into\n       seeing the whole network (Internet) as a huge local area network (LAN).\n       This makes it possible to determine the receiving end of the IPv4 tunnel\n       automatically. However, this method does not scale very well and is also\n       hampered because IP multicasting is far from widespread on the Internet.\n       Therefore, it only provides a solution for smaller corporate or\n       institutional networks where multicasting can be enabled. The\n       specifications for this method are laid down in RFC 2529.\n6to4\nWith this method, IPv4 addresses are automatically generated from IPv6\n       addresses, enabling isolated IPv6 hosts to communicate over an IPv4\n       network. However, several problems have been reported regarding the\n       communication between those isolated IPv6 hosts and the Internet. The\n       method is described in RFC 3056.\nIPv6 tunnel broker\nThis method relies on special servers that provide dedicated tunnels for\n       IPv6 hosts. It is described in RFC 3053.\n23.2.4\nConfiguring IPv6\n#\nTo configure IPv6, you normally do not need to make any changes on the\n    individual workstations. IPv6 is enabled by default. To disable or enable\n    IPv6 on an installed system, use the YaST\nNetwork\n    Settings\nmodule. On the\nGlobal Options\ntab,\n    select or deselect the\nEnable IPv6\noption as necessary.\n    \n    To enable it temporarily until the next reboot, enter\nmodprobe\n-i ipv6\nas\nroot\n. It is impossible to unload\n    the IPv6 module after it has been loaded.\nBecause of the autoconfiguration concept of IPv6, the network card is\n    assigned an address in the\nlink-local\nnetwork.\n    Normally, no routing table management takes place on a workstation. The\n    network routers can be queried by the workstation, using the\nrouter advertisement protocol\n, for what prefix and\n    gateways should be implemented. The radvd program can be used to set up an\n    IPv6 router. This program informs the workstations which prefix to use for\n    the IPv6 addresses and which routers. Alternatively, use zebra/quagga for\n    automatic configuration of both addresses and routing.\nFor information about how to set up various types of tunnels using the\n/etc/sysconfig/network\nfiles, see the man page of\nifcfg-tunnel\n(\nman ifcfg-tunnel\n).\n23.2.5\nMore information\n#\nThe above overview does not cover the topic of IPv6 comprehensively. For a\n    more in-depth look at the newer protocol, refer to the following online\n    documentation and books:\nhttps://pulse.internetsociety.org\nThe starting point for everything about IPv6.\nhttp://www.ipv6day.org\nAll information needed to start your own IPv6 network.\nhttp://www.ipv6-to-standard.org/\nThe list of IPv6-enabled products.\nhttp://www.bieringer.de/linux/IPv6/\nHere, find the Linux IPv6-HOWTO and many links related to the topic.\nRFC 2460\nThe fundamental RFC about IPv6, see\nhttps://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2460\n.\nIPv6 essentials\nA book describing all the important aspects of the topic is\nIPv6 Essentials\nby Silvia Hagen (ISBN\n       0-596-00125-8).\n23.3\nName resolution\n#\nDNS assists in assigning an IP address to one or more names and assigning a\n   name to an IP address. In Linux, this conversion is usually carried out by a\n   special type of software known as bind. The machine that takes care of this\n   conversion is called a\nname server\n. The names make up a\n   hierarchical system in which each name component is separated by a period.\n   The name hierarchy is, however, independent of the IP address hierarchy\n   described above.\nConsider a complete name, such as\njupiter.example.com\n, written in the\n   format\nhostname.domain\n. A full\n   name, called a\nfully qualified domain name\n(FQDN),\n   consists of a host name and a domain name\n   (\nexample.com\n). The latter\n   also includes the\ntop level domain\nor TLD\n   (\ncom\n).\nTLD assignment has become quite confusing for historical reasons.\n   Traditionally, three-letter domain names are used in the USA. In the rest of\n   the world, the two-letter ISO national codes are the standard. In addition\n   to that, longer TLDs were introduced in 2000 that represent certain spheres\n   of activity (for example,\n.info\n,\n.name\n,\n.museum\n).\nIn the early days of the Internet (before 1990), the file\n/etc/hosts\nwas used to store the names of all the\n   machines represented over the Internet. This quickly proved to be\n   impractical in the face of the rapidly growing number of computers connected\n   to the Internet. For this reason, a decentralized database was developed to\n   store the host names in a widely distributed manner. This database, similar\n   to the name server, does not have the data pertaining to all hosts in the\n   Internet readily available, but can dispatch requests to other name servers.\nThe top of the hierarchy is occupied by\nroot name\n   servers\n. These root name servers manage the top level domains and\n   are run by the Network Information Center (NIC). Each root name server knows\n   about the name servers responsible for a given top level domain. Information\n   about top level domain NICs is available at\nhttp://www.internic.net\n.\nDNS can do more than resolve host names. The name server also knows which\n   host is receiving e-mails for an entire domain—the\nmail\n   exchanger (MX)\n.\nFor your machine to resolve an IP address, it must know about at least one\n   name server and its IP address.\nEasily specify\n   such a name server using YaST.\nThe\n   configuration of name server access with\nSUSE® Linux Enterprise Server\nis described in\nSection 23.4.1.4, “Configuring host name and DNS”\n. Setting up your own name\n   server is described in\nChapter 39,\nThe domain name system\n.\nThe protocol\nwhois\nis closely related to DNS. With this\n   program, quickly find out who is responsible for a given domain.\nNote: MDNS and .local domain names\nThe\n.local\ntop level domain is treated as link-local\n    domain by the resolver. DNS requests are sent as multicast DNS requests\n    instead of normal DNS requests. If you already use the\n.local\ndomain in your name server configuration, you\n    must switch this option off in\n/etc/host.conf\n. For\n    more information, see the\nhost.conf\nmanual page.\nTo switch off MDNS during installation, use\nnomdns=1\nas\n    a boot parameter.\nFor more information on multicast DNS, see\nhttp://www.multicastdns.org\n.\n23.4\nConfiguring a network connection with YaST\n#\nThere are many supported networking types on Linux. Most of them use\n  different device names and the configuration files are spread over several\n  locations in the file system. For a detailed overview of the aspects of\n  manual network configuration, see\nSection 23.5, “Configuring a network connection manually”\n.\nAll network interfaces with link\n  up (with a network cable connected) are automatically configured.\nAdditional hardware can be configured any time on the installed system. The\n  following sections describe the network configuration for all types of\n  network connections supported by\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n.\nTip: IBM Z: hotpluggable network cards\nOn IBM Z platforms, hotpluggable network cards are supported, but\n   not their automatic network integration via DHCP (as is the case on the PC).\n   After they have been detected, you need to manually configure the interface.\n23.4.1\nConfiguring the network card with YaST\n#\nTo configure your Ethernet or Wi-Fi/Bluetooth card in YaST, select\nSystem\n›\nNetwork Settings\n. After starting the module, YaST displays the\nNetwork Settings\ndialog with four tabs:\nGlobal\n   Options\n,\nOverview\n,\nHostname/DNS\nand\nRouting\n.\nThe\nGlobal Options\ntab allows you to set general\n   networking options such as the network setup method, IPv6, and general DHCP\n   options. For more information, see\nSection 23.4.1.1, “Configuring global networking options”\n.\nThe\nOverview\ntab contains information about installed\n   network interfaces and configurations. Any properly detected network card is\n   listed with its name. You can manually configure new cards, remove or change\n   their configuration in this dialog. To manually configure a card\n   that was not automatically detected, see\nSection 23.4.1.3, “Configuring an undetected network card”\n. To change the\n   configuration of an already configured card, see\nSection 23.4.1.2, “Changing the configuration of a network card”\n.\nThe\nHostname/DNS\ntab allows to set the host name of the\n   machine and name the servers to be used. For more information, see\nSection 23.4.1.4, “Configuring host name and DNS”\n.\nThe\nRouting\ntab is used for the configuration of routing.\n   See\nSection 23.4.1.5, “Configuring routing”\nfor more information.\nFigure 23.3:\nConfiguring network settings\n#\n23.4.1.1\nConfiguring global networking options\n#\nThe\nGlobal Options\ntab of the YaST\nNetwork\n    Settings\nmodule allows you to set important global networking\n    options, such as the use of NetworkManager, IPv6 and DHCP client options. These\n    settings are applicable for all network interfaces.\nNote: NetworkManager provided by workstation extension\nNetworkManager is now provided by the SUSE Linux Enterprise Workstation Extension. To install NetworkManager, activate the\n     Workstation Extension repository, and select the NetworkManager packages.\nIn the\nNetwork Setup Method\nchoose the way network\n    connections are managed. If you want a NetworkManager desktop applet to manage\n    connections for all interfaces, choose\nNetworkManager Service\n.\n    NetworkManager is well suited for switching between multiple wired and wireless\n    networks. If you do not run a desktop environment, or if your computer is a\n    Xen server, virtual system, or provides network services such as DHCP or\n    DNS in your network, use the\nWicked Service\nmethod. If\n    NetworkManager is used,\nnm-applet\nshould be used to configure\n    network options and the\nOverview\n,\nHostname/DNS\nand\nRouting\ntabs of the\nNetwork Settings\nmodule are disabled.\nFor more information\n    on NetworkManager, see the SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop documentation.\nIn the\nIPv6 Protocol Settings\nchoose whether to use the\n    IPv6 protocol. It is possible to use IPv6 together with IPv4. By default,\n    IPv6 is enabled. However, in networks not using IPv6 protocol, response\n    times can be faster with IPv6 protocol disabled. To disable IPv6,\n    deactivate\nEnable IPv6\n. If IPv6 is disabled, the kernel\n    no longer loads the IPv6 module automatically. This setting will be applied\n    after reboot.\nIn the\nDHCP Client Options\nconfigure options for the\n    DHCP client.\n\n\n    The\nDHCP Client Identifier\nmust be different for each\n    DHCP client on a single network. If left empty, it defaults to the hardware\n    address of the network interface. However, if you are running several\n    virtual machines using the same network interface and, therefore, the same\n    hardware address, specify a unique free-form identifier here.\nThe\nHostname to Send\nspecifies a string used for the\n    host name option field when the DHCP client sends messages to DHCP server.\n    Some DHCP servers update name server zones (forward and reverse records)\n    according to this host name (Dynamic DNS). Also, some DHCP servers require\n    the\nHostname to Send\noption field to contain a specific\n    string in the DHCP messages from clients. Leave\nAUTO\nto\n    send the current host name (that is the one defined in\n/etc/hostname\n). Make the option field empty for not\n    sending any host name.\nIf you do not want to change the default route according to the information\n    from DHCP, deactivate\nChange Default Route via DHCP\n.\n23.4.1.2\nChanging the configuration of a network card\n#\nTo change the configuration of a network card, select a card from the list\n    of the detected cards in\nNetwork Settings\n›\nOverview\nin YaST and click\nEdit\n. The\nNetwork Card Setup\ndialog\n    appears in which to adjust the card configuration using the\nGeneral\n,\nAddress\nand\nHardware\ntabs.\n23.4.1.2.1\nConfiguring IP addresses\n#\nYou can set the IP address of the network card or the way its IP address\n     is determined in the\nAddress\ntab of the\nNetwork Card Setup\ndialog. Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses\n     are supported. The network card can have\nNo IP Address\n(which is useful for bonding devices), a\nStatically Assigned IP\n     Address\n(IPv4 or IPv6) or a\nDynamic Address\nassigned via\nDHCP\nor\nZeroconf\nor\n     both.\nIf using\nDynamic Address\n, select whether to use\nDHCP Version 4 Only\n(for IPv4),\nDHCP Version 6\n     Only\n(for IPv6) or\nDHCP Both Version 4 and 6\n.\nIf possible, the first network card with link that is available during the\n     installation is automatically configured to use automatic address setup\n     via DHCP.\nNote: IBM Z and DHCP\nOn IBM Z platforms, DHCP-based address configuration is only\n      supported with network cards that have a MAC address. This is only the\n      case with OSA and OSA Express cards.\nDHCP should also be used if you are using a DSL line but with no static IP\n     assigned by the ISP (Internet Service Provider). If you decide to use\n     DHCP, configure the details in\nDHCP Client Options\nin\n     the\nGlobal Options\ntab of the\nNetwork\n     Settings\ndialog of the YaST network card configuration module.\n     If you have a virtual host setup where different hosts communicate through\n     the same interface, an\nDHCP Client Identifier\nis\n     necessary to distinguish them.\nDHCP is a good choice for client configuration but it is not ideal for\n     server configuration. To set a static IP address, proceed as follows:\nSelect a card from the list of detected cards in the\nOverview\ntab of the YaST network card configuration\n       module and click\nEdit\n.\nIn the\nAddress\ntab, choose\nStatically\n       Assigned IP Address\n.\nEnter the\nIP Address\n. Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses\n       can be used. Enter the network mask in\nSubnet Mask\n.\n       If the IPv6 address is used, use\nSubnet Mask\nfor\n       prefix length in format\n/64\n.\nOptionally, you can enter a fully qualified\nHostname\nfor this address, which will be written to the\n/etc/hosts\nconfiguration file.\nClick\nNext\n.\nTo activate the configuration, click\nOK\n.\nNote: Interface activation and link detection\nDuring activation of a network interface,\nwicked\nchecks for a carrier and only applies the IP configuration when a link\n      has been detected. If you need to apply the configuration regardless of\n      the link status (for example, when you want to test a service listening to a\n      certain address), you can skip link detection by adding the variable\nLINK_REQUIRED=no\nto the configuration file of the\n      interface in\n/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg\n.\nAdditionally, you can use the variable\nLINK_READY_WAIT=\n5\nto\n      specify the timeout for waiting for a link in seconds.\nFor more information about the\nifcfg-*\nconfiguration\n      files, refer to\nSection 23.5.2.5, “\n/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-*\n”\nand\nman 5 ifcfg\n.\nIf you use the static address, the name servers and default gateway are\n     not configured automatically. To configure name servers, proceed as\n     described in\nSection 23.4.1.4, “Configuring host name and DNS”\n. To configure\n     a gateway, proceed as described in\nSection 23.4.1.5, “Configuring routing”\n.\n23.4.1.2.2\nConfiguring multiple addresses\n#\nA single network device can have multiple IP addresses called aliases or labels.\nNote: Aliases are a compatibility feature\nAliases or labels work with IPv4 only. Using\niproute2\nnetwork interfaces makes it possible to have one or more addresses.\nTo set additional addresses for your network card using YaST, proceed as\n     follows:\nSelect a card from the list of detected cards in the\nOverview\ntab of the YaST\nNetwork\n       Settings\ndialog and click\nEdit\n.\nIn the\nAddress\n›\nAdditional\n       Addresses\ntab, click\nAdd\n.\nEnter\nIPv4 Address Label\n,\nIP\n       Address\n, and\nNetmask\n. Note that IP aliases must be added with the\n/32\nnetmask. Do not include the\n       interface name in the alias name.\nTo activate the configuration, confirm the settings.\n23.4.1.2.3\nChanging the device name and udev rules\n#\nIt is possible to change the device name of the network card when it is\n     used. It is also possible to determine whether the network card should be\n     identified by udev via its hardware (MAC) address or via the bus ID. The\n     latter option is preferable in large servers to simplify hotplugging of\n     cards. To set these options with YaST, proceed as follows:\nSelect a card from the list of detected cards in the\nOverview\ntab of the YaST\nNetwork\n       Settings\ndialog and click\nEdit\n.\nGo to the\nGeneral\ntab. The current device name is\n       shown in\nUdev Rules\n. Click\nChange\n.\nSelect whether udev should identify the card by its\nMAC\n       Address\nor\nBus ID\n. The current MAC address\n       and bus ID of the card are shown in the dialog.\nTo change the device name, check the\nChange Device\n       Name\noption and edit the name.\nTo activate the configuration, confirm the settings.\n23.4.1.2.4\nChanging network card kernel driver\n#\nFor some network cards, several kernel drivers may be available. If the\n     card is already configured, YaST allows you to select a kernel driver to\n     be used from a list of available suitable drivers. It is also possible to\n     specify options for the kernel driver. To set these options with YaST,\n     proceed as follows:\nSelect a card from the list of detected cards in the\nOverview\ntab of the YaST Network Settings module\n       and click\nEdit\n.\nGo to the\nHardware\ntab.\nSelect the kernel driver to be used in\nModule Name\n.\n       Enter any options for the selected driver in\nOptions\nin the form\n=\n=\nVALUE\n. If more options\n       are used, they should be space-separated.\nTo activate the configuration, confirm the settings.\n23.4.1.2.5\nActivating the network device\n#\nIf you use the method with\nwicked\n, you can configure\n     your device to either start during boot, on cable connection, on card\n     detection, manually, or never. To change device start-up, proceed as\n     follows:\nIn YaST select a card from the list of detected cards in\nSystem\n›\nNetwork Settings\nand click\nEdit\n.\nIn the\nGeneral\ntab, select the desired entry from\nDevice Activation\n.\nChoose\nAt Boot Time\nto start the device during the\n       system boot. With\nOn Cable Connection\n, the interface\n       is watched for any existing physical connection. With\nOn\n       Hotplug\n, the interface is set when available. It is similar to\n       the\nAt Boot Time\noption, and only differs in that no\n       error occurs if the interface is not present at boot time. Choose\nManually\nto control the interface manually with\nifup\n. Choose\nNever\nto not start\n       the device. The\nOn NFSroot\nis similar to\nAt\n       Boot Time\n, but the interface does not shut down with the\nsystemctl stop network\ncommand; the\nnetwork\nservice also cares about the\nwicked\nservice if\nwicked\nis active.\n       Use this if you use an NFS or iSCSI root file system.\nTo activate the configuration, confirm the settings.\nTip: NFS as a root file system\nOn (diskless) systems where the root partition is mounted via network as\n      an NFS share, you need to be careful when configuring the network device\n      with which the NFS share is accessible.\nWhen shutting down or rebooting the system, the default processing order\n      is to turn off network connections, then unmount the root partition. With\n      NFS root, this order causes problems as the root partition cannot be\n      cleanly unmounted as the network connection to the NFS share is already\n      not activated. To prevent the system from deactivating the relevant\n      network device, open the network device configuration tab as described in\nSection 23.4.1.2.5, “Activating the network device”\nand choose\nOn\n      NFSroot\nin the\nDevice Activation\npane.\n23.4.1.2.6\nSetting up maximum transfer unit size\n#\nYou can set a maximum transmission unit (MTU) for the interface. MTU\n     refers to the largest allowed packet size in bytes. A higher MTU brings\n     higher bandwidth efficiency. However, large packets can block up a slow\n     interface for some time, increasing the lag for further packets.\nIn YaST select a card from the list of detected cards in\nSystem\n›\nNetwork Settings\nand click\nEdit\n.\nIn the\nGeneral\ntab, select the desired entry from the\nSet MTU\nlist.\nTo activate the configuration, confirm the settings.\n23.4.1.2.7\nPCIe multifunction devices\n#\nMultifunction devices that support LAN, iSCSI, and FCoE are supported.\n     The YaST FCoE client (\nyast2 fcoe-client\n) shows the\n     private flags in additional columns to allow the user to select the device\n     meant for FCoE. The YaST network module (\nyast2 lan\n)\n     excludes\n“\nstorage only devices\n”\nfor network configuration.\nFor more information about FCoE, see\nSection 16.3, “Managing FCoE services with YaST”\n.\n23.4.1.2.8\nInfiniband configuration for IP-over-InfiniBand (IPoIB)\n#\nIn YaST select the InfiniBand device in\nSystem\n›\nNetwork Settings\nand click\nEdit\n.\nIn the\nGeneral\ntab, select one of the\nIP-over-InfiniBand\n(IPoIB) modes:\nconnected\n(default) or\ndatagram\n.\nTo activate the configuration, confirm the settings.\nFor more information about InfiniBand, see\n/usr/src/linux/Documentation/infiniband/ipoib.txt\n.\n23.4.1.2.9\nConfiguring the firewall\n#\nWithout having to perform the detailed firewall setup as described in\nSection 23.4, “\nfirewalld\n”\n, you can determine the\n     basic firewall configuration for your device as part of the device setup.\n     Proceed as follows:\nOpen the YaST\nSystem\n›\nNetwork\n       Settings\nmodule. In the\nOverview\ntab, select a card from the list of detected\n       cards and click\nEdit\n.\nEnter the\nGeneral\ntab of the\nNetwork\n       Settings\ndialog.\nDetermine the\nFirewall Zone\nto which your interface\n       should be assigned. The following options are available:\nFirewall disabled\nThis option is available only if the firewall is disabled and the\n          firewall does not run. Only use this option if your machine is part\n          of a greater network that is protected by an outer firewall.\nAutomatically assign zone\nThis option is available only if the firewall is enabled. The\n          firewall is running and the interface is automatically assigned to a\n          firewall zone. The zone which contains the keyword\nany\nor the external zone will be used for such an\n          interface.\nInternal zone (unprotected)\nThe firewall is running, but does not enforce any rules to protect\n          this interface. Use this option if your machine is part of a greater\n          network that is protected by an outer firewall. It is also useful for\n          the interfaces connected to the internal network, when the machine\n          has more network interfaces.\nDemilitarized zone\nA demilitarized zone is an additional line of defense in front of an\n          internal network and the (hostile) Internet. Hosts assigned to this\n          zone can be reached from the internal network and from the Internet,\n          but cannot access the internal network.\nExternal zone\nThe firewall is running on this interface and fully protects it\n          against other—presumably hostile—network traffic. This is\n          the default option.\nTo activate the configuration, confirm the settings.\n23.4.1.3\nConfiguring an undetected network card\n#\nIf a network card is not detected correctly, the card is not included in\n    the list of detected cards. If you are sure that your system includes a\n    driver for your card, you can configure it manually. You can also configure\n    special network device types, such as bridge, bond, TUN or TAP. To\n    configure an undetected network card (or a special device) proceed as\n    follows:\nIn the\nSystem\n›\nNetwork\n      Settings\n›\nOverview\ndialog in\n      YaST click\nAdd\n.\nIn the\nHardware\ndialog, set the\nDevice\n      Type\nof the interface from the available options and\nConfiguration Name\n. If the network card is a\n      USB device, activate the respective check box and exit this dialog with\nNext\n. Otherwise, you can define the kernel\nModule Name\nto be used for the card and its\nOptions\n, if necessary.\nIn\nEthtool Options\n, you can set\nethtool\noptions used by\nifup\nfor\n      the interface. For information about available options, see the\nethtool\nmanual page.\nIf the option string starts with a\n-\n(for example,\n-K\nINTERFACE_NAME\nrx on\n), the second\n      word in the string is replaced with the current interface name. Otherwise\n      (for example,\nautoneg off speed 10\n)\nifup\nadds\n-s\nINTERFACE_NAME\nto the beginning.\nClick\nNext\n.\nConfigure any needed options, such as the IP address, device activation\n      or firewall zone for the interface in the\nGeneral\n,\nAddress\n, and\nHardware\ntabs. For\n      more information about the configuration options, see\nSection 23.4.1.2, “Changing the configuration of a network card”\n.\nIf you selected\nWireless\nas the device type of the\n      interface, configure the wireless connection in the next dialog.\nTo activate the new network configuration, confirm the settings.\n23.4.1.4\nConfiguring host name and DNS\n#\nIf you did not change the network configuration during installation and the\n    Ethernet card was already available, a host name was automatically\n    generated for your computer and DHCP was activated. The same applies to the\n    name service information your host needs to integrate into a network\n    environment. If DHCP is used for network address setup, the list of domain\n    name servers is automatically filled with the appropriate data. If a static\n    setup is preferred, set these values manually.\nTo change the name of your computer and adjust the name server search list,\n    proceed as follows:\nGo to the\nNetwork Settings\n›\nHostname/DNS\ntab in the\nSystem\nmodule in YaST.\nEnter the\nHostname\n. Note that the host name is global\n      and applies to all network interfaces.\nIf you are using DHCP to get an IP address, the host name of your\n      computer will be automatically set by the DHCP server. You should disable this\n      behavior if you connect to different networks, because they may assign\n      different host names and changing the host name at runtime may confuse\n      the graphical desktop. To disable using DHCP to get an IP address\n      deactivate\nChange Hostname via DHCP\n.\nIn\nModify DNS Configuration\n, select the way the DNS\n      configuration (name servers, search list, the content of the\n/run/netconfig/resolv.conf\nfile) is modified.\nIf the\nUse Default Policy\noption is selected, the\n      configuration is handled by the\nnetconfig\nscript which\n      merges the data defined statically (with YaST or in the configuration\n      files) with data obtained dynamically (from the DHCP client or\n      NetworkManager). This default policy is usually sufficient.\nIf the\nOnly Manually\noption is selected,\nnetconfig\nis not allowed to modify the\n/run/netconfig/resolv.conf\nfile. However, this file can be\n      edited manually.\nIf the\nCustom Policy\noption is selected, a\nCustom Policy Rule\nstring defining the merge policy\n      should be specified. The string consists of a comma-separated list of\n      interface names to be considered a valid source of settings. Except for\n      complete interface names, basic wild cards to match multiple interfaces\n      are allowed, as well. For example,\neth* ppp?\nwill\n      first target all eth and then all ppp0-ppp9 interfaces. There are two\n      special policy values that indicate how to apply the static settings\n      defined in the\n/etc/sysconfig/network/config\nfile:\nSTATIC\nThe static settings need to be merged together with the dynamic\n         settings.\nSTATIC_FALLBACK\nThe static settings are used only when no dynamic configuration is\n         available.\nFor more information, see the man page of\nnetconfig\n(8)\n      (\nman 8 netconfig\n).\nEnter the\nName Servers\nand fill in the\nDomain\n      Search\nlist. Name servers must be specified by IP addresses,\n      such as 192.168.1.116, not by host names. Names specified in the\nDomain Search\ntab are domain names used for resolving\n      host names without a specified domain. If more than one\nDomain\n      Search\nis used, separate domains with commas or white space.\nTo activate the configuration, confirm the settings.\nIt is also possible to edit the host name using YaST from the command\n    line. The changes made by YaST take effect immediately (which is not the\n    case when editing the\n/etc/hostname\nfile manually). To\n    change the host name, use the following command:\n#\nyast dns edit hostname=\nHOSTNAME\nTo change the name servers, use the following commands:\n#\nyast dns edit nameserver1=192.168.1.116\n#\nyast dns edit nameserver2=192.168.1.117\n#\nyast dns edit nameserver3=192.168.1.118\n23.4.1.5\nConfiguring routing\n#\nTo make your machine communicate with other machines and other networks,\n    routing information must be given to make network traffic take the correct\n    path. If DHCP is used, this information is automatically provided. If a\n    static setup is used, this data must be added manually.\nIn YaST go to\nNetwork Settings\n›\nRouting\n.\nEnter the IP address of the\nDefault Gateway\n(IPv4 and\n      IPv6 if necessary). The default gateway matches every possible\n      destination, but if a routing table entry exists that matches the\n      required address, this will be used instead of the default route via the\n      Default Gateway.\nMore entries can be entered in the\nRouting Table\n.\n      Enter the\nDestination\nnetwork IP address,\nGateway\nIP address and the\nNetmask\n.\n      Select the\nDevice\nthrough which the traffic to the\n      defined network will be routed (the minus sign stands for any device).\n      \n      To omit any of these values, use the minus sign\n-\n. To\n      enter a default gateway into the table, use\ndefault\nin\n      the\nDestination\nfield.\nNote: Route prioritization\nIf more default routes are used, it is possible to specify the metric\n       option to determine which route has a higher priority. To specify the\n       metric option, enter\n- metric\nNUMBER\nin\nOptions\n.\n       The lowest possible metric is 0. The route with the lowest metric has the\n       highest priority and is used as default. If the network device is\n       disconnected, its route will be removed and the next one will be used.\nIf the system is a router, enable\nIPv4 Forwarding\nand\nIPv6 Forwarding\nin the\nNetwork\n      Settings\nas needed.\nTo activate the configuration, confirm the settings.\n23.4.2\nIBM Z: configuring network devices\n#\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nfor IBM Z supports several types of network interfaces.\n  YaST can be used to configure all of them.\n23.4.2.1\nThe qeth-hsi device\n#\nTo add a\nqeth-hsi\n(HiperSockets) interface to the\n   installed system, start the\nSystem\n›\nNetwork Settings\nmodule in YaST. Select\n   one of the devices marked\nHipersocket\nto use as the READ\n   device address and click\nEdit\n. Enter the device numbers\n   for the read, write and control channels (example device number format:\n0.0.0800\n). Then click next. In the\nNetwork\n   Address Setup\ndialog, specify the IP address and netmask for the\n   new interface and leave the network configuration by clicking\nNext\nand\nOK\n.\n23.4.2.2\nThe qeth-ethernet device\n#\nTo add a\nqeth-ethernet\n(IBM OSA Express Ethernet Card)\n   interface to the installed system, start the\nSystem\n›\nNetwork Settings\nmodule in YaST. Select one of the devices marked\nIBM OSA Express\n   Ethernet Card\nto use as the READ device address and click\nEdit\n. Enter a device number for the read, write and\n   control channels (example device number format:\n0.0.0700\n). Enter the needed port name, port number (if\n   applicable) and some additional options, your IP address, and an appropriate\n   netmask. Leave the network configuration with\nNext\nand\nOK\n.\n23.4.2.3\nThe ctc device\n#\nTo add a\nctc\n(IBM parallel CTC Adapter) interface to the\n   installed system, start the\nSystem\n›\nNetwork Settings\nmodule in YaST. Select\n   one of the devices marked\nIBM Parallel CTC Adapter\nto use\n   as your read channel and click\nConfigure\n. Choose the\nDevice Settings\nthat fit your devices (usually this would\n   be\nCompatibility Mode\n). Specify both your IP address and\n   the IP address of the remote partner. If needed, adjust the MTU size with\nAdvanced\n›\nDetailed\n   Settings\n. Leave the network configuration with\nNext\nand\nOK\n.\nWarning: CTC is no longer supported\nThe use of this interface is deprecated. This interface will not be\n    supported in future versions of\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n.\n23.4.2.4\nThe lcs device\n#\nTo add an\nlcs\n(IBM OSA-2 Adapter) interface to the\n   installed system, start the\nSystem\n›\nNetwork Settings\nmodule in YaST.

Leave the network\n   configuration with\nNext\nand\nOK\n.\n23.4.2.5\nThe IUCV device\n#\nTo add an\niucv\n(IUCV) interface to the installed system,\n   start the\nSystem\n›\nNetwork\n   Settings\nmodule in YaST. Select a device marked\nIUCV\nand click\nEdit\n. YaST prompts\n   you for the name of your IUCV partner (\nPeer\n). Enter the\n   name (this entry is case-sensitive) and select\nNext\n.\n   Specify both the\nIP Address\nand the\nRemote IP\n   Address\nof your partner. If needed,\nSet MTU\nsize on\nGeneral\ntab. Leave the network configuration with\nNext\nand\nOK\n.\nWarning: IUCV is no longer supported\nThe use of this interface is deprecated. This interface will not be\n    supported in future versions of\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n.\n23.5\nConfiguring a network connection manually\n#\nManual configuration of the network software should be the last alternative.\n  Using YaST is recommended. However, this background information about the\n  network configuration can also assist your work with YaST.\n23.5.1\nThe\nwicked\nnetwork configuration\n#\nThe tool and library called\nwicked\nprovides a new\n   framework for network configuration.\nOne of the challenges with traditional network interface management is that\n   different layers of network management get jumbled together into one single\n   script, or at most two different scripts. These scripts interact with each other in a\n   way that is not well defined. This leads to unpredictable issues, obscure\n   constraints and conventions, etc. Several layers of special hacks for a variety of different scenarios increase the maintenance\n   burden. Address configuration protocols are being used that are implemented\n   via daemons like dhcpcd, which interact rather poorly with the rest of the\n   infrastructure. Funky interface naming schemes that require heavy udev\n   support are introduced to achieve persistent identification of interfaces.\nThe idea of wicked is to decompose the problem in several ways. None of them\n   is entirely novel, but trying to put ideas from different projects together\n   is hopefully going to create a better solution overall.\nOne approach is to use a client/server model. This allows wicked to define\n   standardized facilities for things like address configuration that are well\n   integrated with the overall framework. For example, using a specific address\n   configuration, the administrator may request that an interface should be\n   configured via DHCP or IPv4 zeroconf. In this case, the address configuration\n   service simply obtains the lease from its server and passes it on to the\n   wicked server process that installs the requested addresses and routes.\nThe other approach to decomposing the problem is to enforce the layering\n   aspect. For any type of network interface, it is possible to define a dbus\n   service that configures the network interface's device layer—a VLAN, a\n   bridge, a bonding, or a paravirtualized device. Common functionality, such\n   as address configuration, is implemented by joint services that are layered\n   on top of these device specific services without having to implement them\n   specifically.\nThe wicked framework implements these two aspects by using a variety of dbus\n   services, which get attached to a network interface depending on its type.\n   Here is a rough overview of the current object hierarchy in wicked.\nEach network interface is represented via a child object of\n/org/opensuse/Network/Interfaces\n. The name of the\n   child object is given by its ifindex. For example, the loopback interface,\n   which usually gets ifindex 1, is\n/org/opensuse/Network/Interfaces/1\n, the first\n   Ethernet interface registered is\n/org/opensuse/Network/Interfaces/2\n.\nEach network interface has a\n“\nclass\n”\nassociated with it, which\n   is used to select the dbus interfaces it supports. By default, each network\n   interface is of class\nnetif\n, and\nwickedd\nwill automatically\n   attach all interfaces compatible with this class. In the current\n   implementation, this includes the following interfaces:\norg.opensuse.Network.Interface\nGeneric network interface functions, such as taking the link up or down,\n      assigning an MTU, etc.\norg.opensuse.Network.Addrconf.ipv4.dhcp,\norg.opensuse.Network.Addrconf.ipv6.dhcp,\norg.opensuse.Network.Addrconf.ipv4.auto\nAddress configuration services for DHCP,\n\n      IPv4 zeroconf, etc.\nBeyond this, network interfaces may require or offer special configuration\n   mechanisms. For an Ethernet device, for example, you should be able to\n   control the link speed, offloading of checksumming, etc. To achieve this,\n   Ethernet devices have a class of their own, called\nnetif-ethernet\n, which is a subclass of\nnetif\n. As a consequence, the dbus interfaces assigned to\n   an Ethernet interface include all the services listed above, plus the\norg.opensuse.Network.Ethernet\nservice available only to objects belonging to the\nnetif-ethernet\nclass.\nSimilarly, there exist classes for interface types like bridges, VLANs,\n   bonds, or infinibands.\nHow do you interact with an interface like VLAN (which is really a virtual network interface that\n   sits on top of an Ethernet device) that needs to be created\n   first? For this, wicked defines factory\n   interfaces, such as\norg.opensuse.Network.VLAN.Factory\n. Such a factory\n   interface offers a single function that lets you create an interface of the\n   requested type. These factory interfaces are attached to the\n/org/opensuse/Network/Interfaces\nlist node.\n23.5.1.1\nwicked\narchitecture and features\n#\nThe\nwicked\nservice comprises several parts as depicted\n    in\nFigure 23.4, “\nwicked\narchitecture”\n.\nFigure 23.4:\nwicked\narchitecture\n#\nwicked\ncurrently supports the following:\nConfiguration file back-ends to parse SUSE style\n/etc/sysconfig/network\nfiles.\nAn internal configuration back-end to represent network interface\n      configuration in XML.\nBring up and shutdown of\n“\nnormal\n”\nnetwork interfaces such as\n      Ethernet or InfiniBand, VLAN, bridge, bonds, tun, tap, dummy, macvlan,\n      macvtap, hsi, qeth, iucv, and wireless (currently limited to one\n      wpa-psk/eap network) devices.\nA built-in DHCPv4 client and a built-in DHCPv6 client.\nThe nanny daemon (enabled by default) helps to automatically bring up\n      configured interfaces when the device is available (interface\n      hotplugging) and set up the IP configuration when a link (carrier) is\n      detected. See\nSection 23.5.1.3, “Nanny”\nfor more\n      information.\nwicked\nwas implemented as a group of DBus services\n      that are integrated with systemd. So the usual\nsystemctl\ncommands will apply to\nwicked\n.\n23.5.1.2\nUsing\nwicked\n#\nOn SUSE Linux Enterprise,\nwicked\nruns by default. If you want to check\n    what is currently enabled and whether it is running, call:\nsystemctl status network\nIf\nwicked\nis enabled, you will see something along these\n    lines:\nwicked.service - wicked managed network interfaces\n    Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/wicked.service; enabled)\n    ...\nIn case something different is running (for example, NetworkManager) and you want to\n    switch to\nwicked\n, first stop what is running and then\n    enable\nwicked\n:\nsystemctl is-active network && \\\nsystemctl stop      network\nsystemctl enable --force wicked\nThis enables the wicked services, creates the\nnetwork.service\nto\nwicked.service\nalias link, and starts the network at the next boot.\nStarting the server process:\nsystemctl start wickedd\nThis starts\nwickedd\n(the main server) and associated\n    supplicants:\n/usr/lib/wicked/bin/wickedd-auto4 --systemd --foreground\n/usr/lib/wicked/bin/wickedd-dhcp4 --systemd --foreground\n/usr/lib/wicked/bin/wickedd-dhcp6 --systemd --foreground\n/usr/sbin/wickedd --systemd --foreground\n/usr/sbin/wickedd-nanny --systemd --foreground\nThen bringing up the network:\nsystemctl start wicked\nAlternatively use the\nnetwork.service\nalias:\nsystemctl start network\nThese commands are using the default or system configuration sources as\n    defined in\n/etc/wicked/client.xml\n.\nTo enable debugging, set\nWICKED_DEBUG\nin\n/etc/sysconfig/network/config\n, for example:\nWICKED_DEBUG=\"all\"\nOr, to omit some:\nWICKED_DEBUG=\"all,-dbus,-objectmodel,-xpath,-xml\"\nUse the client utility to display interface information for all interfaces\n    or the interface specified with\nIFNAME\n:\nwicked show all\nwicked show\nIFNAME\nIn XML output:\nwicked show-xml all\nwicked show-xml\nIFNAME\nBringing up one interface:\nwicked ifup eth0\nwicked ifup wlan0\n...\nBecause there is no configuration source specified, the wicked client\n    checks its default sources of configuration defined in\n/etc/wicked/client.xml\n:\nfirmware:\niSCSI Boot Firmware Table (iBFT)\ncompat:\nifcfg\nfiles—implemented for compatibility\nWhatever\nwicked\ngets from those sources for a given\n    interface is applied. The intended order of importance is\nfirmware\n, then\ncompat\n—this may\n    be changed in the future.\nFor more information, see the\nwicked\nman page.\n23.5.1.3\nNanny\n#\nNanny is an event and policy driven daemon that is responsible for\n    asynchronous or unsolicited scenarios such as hotplugging devices. Thus the\n    nanny daemon helps with starting or restarting delayed or temporarily gone\n    devices. Nanny monitors device and link changes, and integrates new devices\n    defined by the current policy set. Nanny continues to set up even if\nifup\nalready exited because of specified timeout\n    constraints.\nBy default, the nanny daemon is active on the system. It is enabled in the\n/etc/wicked/common.xml\nconfiguration file:\n<config>\n  ...\n  <use-nanny>true</use-nanny>\n</config>\nThis setting causes ifup and ifreload to apply a policy with the effective\n    configuration to the nanny daemon; then, nanny configures\nwickedd\nand thus ensures\n    hotplug support. It waits in the background for events or changes (such as\n    new devices or carrier on).\n23.5.1.4\nBringing up multiple interfaces\n#\nFor bonds and bridges, it may make sense to define the entire device\n    topology in one file (ifcfg-bondX), and bring it up in one go. wicked then\n    can bring up the whole configuration if you specify the top level interface\n    names (of the bridge or bond):\nwicked ifup br0\nThis command automatically sets up the bridge and its dependencies in the\n    appropriate order without the need to list the dependencies (ports, etc.)\n    separately.\nTo bring up multiple interfaces in one command:\nwicked ifup bond0 br0 br1 br2\nOr also all interfaces:\nwicked ifup all\n23.5.1.5\nUsing tunnels with Wicked\n#\nWhen you need to use tunnels with Wicked, the\nTUNNEL_DEVICE\nis used for this. It permits to specify an optional device name to bind\n    the tunnel to the device. The tunneled packets will only be routed via this\n    device.\nFor more information, refer to\nman 5 ifcfg-tunnel\n.\n23.5.1.6\nHandling incremental changes\n#\nWith\nwicked\n, there is no need to actually take down an\n    interface to reconfigure it (unless it is required by the kernel). For\n    example, to add another IP address or route to a statically configured\n    network interface, add the IP address to the interface definition, and do\n    another\n“\nifup\n”\noperation. The server will try hard to update\n    only those settings that have changed. This applies to link-level options\n    such as the device MTU or the MAC address, and network-level settings, such\n    as addresses, routes, or even the address configuration mode (for example,\n    when moving from a static configuration to DHCP).\nThings get tricky of course with virtual interfaces combining several real\n    devices such as bridges or bonds. For bonded devices, it is not possible to\n    change certain parameters while the device is up. Doing that will result in\n    an error.\nHowever, what should still work, is the act of adding or removing the child\n    devices of a bond or bridge, or choosing a bond's primary interface.\n23.5.1.7\nWicked extensions: address configuration\n#\nwicked\nis designed to be extensible with shell scripts.\n    These extensions can be defined in the\nconfig.xml\nfile.\nCurrently, several classes of extensions are supported:\nlink configuration: these are scripts responsible for setting up a\n      device's link layer according to the configuration provided by the\n      client, and for tearing it down again.\naddress configuration: these are scripts responsible for managing a\n      device's address configuration. Usually address configuration and DHCP\n      are managed by\nwicked\nitself, but can be implemented\n      by means of extensions.\nfirewall extension: these scripts can apply firewall rules.\nTypically, extensions have a start and a stop command, an optional\n“\npid file\n”\n, and a set of environment variables that get passed\n    to the script.\nTo illustrate how this is supposed to work, look at a firewall extension\n    defined in\netc/server.xml\n:\n<dbus-service interface=\"org.opensuse.Network.Firewall\">\n <action name=\"firewallUp\"   command=\"/etc/wicked/extensions/firewall up\"/>\n <action name=\"firewallDown\" command=\"/etc/wicked/extensions/firewall down\"/>\n\n <!-- default environment for all calls to this extension script -->\n <putenv name=\"WICKED_OBJECT_PATH\" value=\"$object-path\"/>\n <putenv name=\"WICKED_INTERFACE_NAME\" value=\"$property:name\"/>\n <putenv name=\"WICKED_INTERFACE_INDEX\" value=\"$property:index\"/>\n</dbus-service>\nThe extension is attached to the\n<dbus-service>\ntag and defines commands to execute for the actions of this interface.\n    Further, the declaration can define and initialize environment variables\n    passed to the actions.\n23.5.1.8\nWicked extensions: configuration files\n#\nYou can extend the handling of configuration files with scripts as well.\n    For example, DNS updates from leases are ultimately handled by the\nextensions/resolver\nscript, with behavior configured\n    in\nserver.xml\n:\n<system-updater name=\"resolver\">\n <action name=\"backup\" command=\"/etc/wicked/extensions/resolver backup\"/>\n <action name=\"restore\" command=\"/etc/wicked/extensions/resolver restore\"/>\n <action name=\"install\" command=\"/etc/wicked/extensions/resolver install\"/>\n <action name=\"remove\" command=\"/etc/wicked/extensions/resolver remove\"/>\n</system-updater>\nWhen an update arrives in\nwickedd\n, the system\n    updater routines parse the lease and call the appropriate commands\n    (\nbackup\n,\ninstall\n, etc.) in the\n    resolver script. This in turn configures the DNS settings using\n/sbin/netconfig\n, or by manually writing\n/run/netconfig/resolv.conf\nas a fallback.\n23.5.2\nConfiguration files\n#\nThis section provides an overview of the network configuration files and\n  explains their purpose and the format used.\n23.5.2.1\n/etc/wicked/common.xml\n#\nThe\n/etc/wicked/common.xml\nfile contains common\n   definitions that should be used by all applications. It is sourced/included\n   by the other configuration files in this directory. Although you can use\n   this file to enable debugging across all\nwicked\ncomponents, we recommend to use the file\n/etc/wicked/local.xml\nfor this purpose. After applying\n   maintenance updates you might lose your changes as the\n/etc/wicked/common.xml\nmight be overwritten. The\n/etc/wicked/common.xml\nfile includes the\n/etc/wicked/local.xml\nin the default installation, thus\n   you typically do not need to modify the\n/etc/wicked/common.xml\n.\nIn case you want to disable\nnanny\nby setting the\n<use-nanny>\nto\nfalse\n, restart\n   the\nwickedd.service\nand then run the following command to\n   apply all configurations and policies:\n>\nsudo\nwicked ifup all\nNote: Configuration files\nThe\nwickedd\n,\nwicked\n, or\nnanny\nprograms try to read\n/etc/wicked/common.xml\nif their own configuration\n    files do not exist.\n23.5.2.2\n/etc/wicked/server.xml\n#\nThe file\n/etc/wicked/server.xml\nis read by the\nwickedd\nserver process at start-up. The file stores\n   extensions to the\n/etc/wicked/common.xml\n. On top of\n   that this file configures handling of a resolver and receiving information\n   from\naddrconf\nsupplicants, for example DHCP.\nWe recommend to add changes required to this file into a separate file\n/etc/wicked/server-local.xml\n, that gets included by\n/etc/wicked/server.xml\n. By using a separate file\n   you avoid overwriting of your changes during maintenance updates.\n23.5.2.3\n/etc/wicked/client.xml\n#\nThe\n/etc/wicked/client.xml\nis used by the\nwicked\ncommand. The file specifies the location of a\n   script used when discovering devices managed by ibft and configures\n   locations of network interface configurations.\nWe recommend to add changes required to this file into a separate file\n/etc/wicked/client-local.xml\n, that gets included by\n/etc/wicked/server.xml\n. By using a separate file\n   you avoid overwriting of your changes during maintenance updates.\n23.5.2.4\n/etc/wicked/nanny.xml\n#\nThe\n/etc/wicked/nanny.xml\nconfigures types of link\n   layers. We recommend to add specific configuration into a separate file:\n/etc/wicked/nanny-local.xml\nto avoid losing the changes\n   during maintenance updates.\n23.5.2.5\n/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-*\n#\nThese files contain the traditional configurations for network interfaces.\nNote:\nwicked\nand the\nifcfg-*\nfiles\nwicked\nreads these files if you specify the\ncompat:\nprefix. According to the\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\ndefault\n    configuration in\n/etc/wicked/client.xml\n,\nwicked\ntries these files before the XML configuration\n    files in\n/etc/wicked/ifconfig\n.\nThe\n--ifconfig\nswitch is provided mostly for testing only.\n    If specified, default configuration sources defined in\n/etc/wicked/ifconfig\nare not applied.\nThe\nifcfg-*\nfiles include information such as the start\n   mode and the IP address. Possible parameters are described in the manual\n   page of\nifup\n. Additionally, most variables from the\ndhcp\nand\nwireless\nfiles can be\n   used in the\nifcfg-*\nfiles if a general setting should\n   be used for only one interface. However, most of the\n/etc/sysconfig/network/config\nvariables are global and\n   cannot be overridden in\nifcfg\nfiles. For example,\nNETCONFIG_*\nvariables are global.\nFor configuring\nmacvlan\nand\nmacvtab\ninterfaces, see the\nifcfg-macvlan\nand\nifcfg-macvtap\nman pages. For example, for a macvlan\n   interface provide a\nifcfg-macvlan0\nwith settings as\n   follows:\nSTARTMODE='auto'\nMACVLAN_DEVICE='eth0'\n#MACVLAN_MODE='vepa'\n#LLADDR=02:03:04:05:06:aa\nFor\nifcfg.template\n, see\nSection 23.5.2.6, “\n/etc/sysconfig/network/config\n,\n/etc/sysconfig/network/dhcp\n, and\n/etc/sysconfig/network/wireless\n”\n.\nIBM Z\nIBM Z does not support USB. The names of the interface files and\n   network aliases contain IBM Z-specific elements like\nqeth\n.\n23.5.2.6\n/etc/sysconfig/network/config\n,\n/etc/sysconfig/network/dhcp\n, and\n/etc/sysconfig/network/wireless\n#\nThe file\nconfig\ncontains general settings for the\n   behavior of\nifup\n,\nifdown\nand\nifstatus\n.\ndhcp\ncontains settings for\n   DHCP and\nwireless\nfor wireless LAN cards. The variables\n   in all three configuration files are commented. Some variables from\n/etc/sysconfig/network/config\ncan also be used in\nifcfg-*\nfiles, where they are given a higher priority.\n   The\n/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg.template\nfile lists\n   variables that can be specified in a per interface scope. However, most of\n   the\n/etc/sysconfig/network/config\nvariables are global\n   and cannot be overridden in ifcfg-files. For example,\nNETWORKMANAGER\nor\nNETCONFIG_*\nvariables are global.\nNote: Using DHCPv6\nIn SUSE Linux Enterprise 11, DHCPv6 used to work even on networks\n    where IPv6 Router Advertisements (RAs) were not configured\n    properly. Starting with SUSE Linux Enterprise 12,\nDHCPv6 requires that at least\n    one of the routers on the network sends out RAs that indicate that this\n    network is managed by DHCPv6.\nFor networks where the router cannot be configured correctly, the\nifcfg\noption allows the user to override this\n    behavior by specifying\nDHCLIENT6_MODE='managed'\nin the\nifcfg\nfile.\n\n    You can also activate this workaround with a boot parameter in the\n    installation system:\nifcfg=eth0=dhcp6,DHCLIENT6_MODE=managed\n23.5.2.7\n/etc/sysconfig/network/routes\nand\n/etc/sysconfig/network/ifroute-*\n#\nThe static routing of TCP/IP packets is determined by the\n/etc/sysconfig/network/routes\nand\n/etc/sysconfig/network/ifroute-*\nfiles. All the static\n   routes required by the various system tasks can be specified in\n/etc/sysconfig/network/routes\n: routes to a host, routes\n   to a host via a gateway and routes to a network. For each interface that\n   needs individual routing, define an additional configuration file:\n/etc/sysconfig/network/ifroute-*\n. Replace the wild card\n   (\n*\n) with the name of the interface. The entries in the\n   routing configuration files look like this:\n# Destination     Gateway           Netmask            Interface  Options\nThe route's destination is in the first column. This column may contain the\n   IP address of a network or host or, in the case of\nreachable\nname servers, the fully qualified network or\n   host name. The network should be written in CIDR notation (address with the\n   associated routing prefix-length) such as 10.10.0.0/16 for IPv4 or fc00::/7\n   for IPv6 routes. The keyword\ndefault\nindicates that the\n   route is the default gateway in the same address family as the gateway. For\n   devices without a gateway use explicit 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 destinations.\nThe second column contains the default gateway or a gateway through which a\n   host or network can be accessed.\nThe third column is deprecated; it used to contain the IPv4 netmask of the\n   destination. For IPv6 routes, the default route, or when using a\n   prefix-length (CIDR notation) in the first column, enter a dash\n   (\n-\n) here.\nThe fourth column contains the name of the interface. If you leave it empty\n   using a dash (\n-\n), it can cause unintended behavior in\n/etc/sysconfig/network/routes\n. For more information,\n   see the\nroutes\nman page.\nAn (optional) fifth column can be used to specify special options. For\n   details, see the\nroutes\nman page.\nExample 23.5:\nCommon network interfaces and some static routes\n#\n# --- IPv4 routes in CIDR prefix notation:\n# Destination     [Gateway]         -                  Interface\n127.0.0.0/8       -                 -                  lo\n204.127.235.0/24  -                 -                  eth0\ndefault           204.127.235.41    -                  eth0\n207.68.156.51/32  207.68.145.45     -                  eth1\n192.168.0.0/16    207.68.156.51     -                  eth1\n\n# --- IPv4 routes in deprecated netmask notation\"\n# Destination     [Dummy/Gateway]   Netmask            Interface\n#\n127.0.0.0         0.0.0.0           255.255.255.0      lo\n204.127.235.0     0.0.0.0           255.255.255.0      eth0\ndefault           204.127.235.41    0.0.0.0            eth0\n207.68.156.51     207.68.145.45     255.255.255.255    eth1\n192.168.0.0       207.68.156.51     255.255.0.0        eth1\n\n# --- IPv6 routes are always using CIDR notation:\n# Destination     [Gateway]                -           Interface\n2001:DB8:100::/64 -                        -           eth0\n2001:DB8:100::/32 fe80::216:3eff:fe6d:c042 -           eth0\n23.5.2.8\n/var/run/netconfig/resolv.conf\n#\nThe domain to which the host belongs is specified in\n/var/run/netconfig/resolv.conf\n(keyword\nsearch\n).

It merges statically defined settings with settings\n   provided by autoconfiguration mechanisms as DHCP or PPP according to a\n   predefined policy. The required changes are applied to the system by calling\n   the netconfig modules that are responsible for modifying a configuration\n   file and restarting a service or a similar action.\nnetconfig\nrecognizes three main actions. The\nnetconfig modify\nand\nnetconfig remove\ncommands are used by daemons such as DHCP or PPP to provide or remove\n   settings to netconfig. Only the\nnetconfig update\ncommand\n   is available for the user:\nmodify\nThe\nnetconfig modify\ncommand modifies the current\n      interface and service specific dynamic settings and updates the network\n      configuration. Netconfig reads settings from standard input or from a\n      file specified with the\n--lease-file\nFILENAME\noption and internally stores\n      them until a system reboot (or the next modify or remove action). Already\n      existing settings for the same interface and service combination are\n      overwritten. The interface is specified by the\n-i\nINTERFACE_NAME\nparameter. The service\n      is specified by the\n-s\nSERVICE_NAME\nparameter.\nremove\nThe\nnetconfig remove\ncommand removes the dynamic\n      settings provided by an editing action for the specified interface\n      and service combination and updates the network configuration. The\n      interface is specified by the\n-i\nINTERFACE_NAME\nparameter. The service\n      is specified by the\n-s\nSERVICE_NAME\nparameter.\nupdate\nThe\nnetconfig update\ncommand updates the network\n      configuration using current settings. This is useful when the policy or\n      the static configuration has changed. Use the\n-m\nMODULE_TYPE\nparameter to\n      update a specified service only (\ndns\n,\nnis\n, or\nntp\n).\nThe netconfig policy and the static configuration settings are defined\n   either manually or using YaST in the\n/etc/sysconfig/network/config\nfile. The dynamic\n   configuration settings provided by autoconfiguration tools such as DHCP or\n   PPP are delivered directly by these tools with the\nnetconfig\n   modify\nand\nnetconfig remove\nactions.\n\n   When NetworkManager is enabled, netconfig (in policy mode\nauto\n)\n   uses only NetworkManager settings, ignoring settings from any other interfaces\n   configured using the traditional ifup method. If NetworkManager does not provide any\n   setting, static settings are used as a fallback. A mixed usage of NetworkManager and\n   the\nwicked\nmethod is not supported.\nFor more information about\nnetconfig\n, see\nman 8\n   netconfig\n.\n23.5.2.10\n/etc/hosts\n#\nIn this file, shown in\nExample 23.7, “\n/etc/hosts\n”\n, IP addresses\n   are assigned to host names.

You can work with the\n    following objects:\nlink\nThis object represents a network device.\naddress\nThis object represents the IP address of device.\nneighbor\nThis object represents an ARP or NDISC cache entry.\nroute\nThis object represents the routing table entry.\nrule\nThis object represents a rule in the routing policy database.\nmaddress\nThis object represents a multicast address.\nmroute\nThis object represents a multicast routing cache entry.\ntunnel\nThis object represents a tunnel over IP.\nIf no command is given, the default command is used (usually\nlist\n).\nChange the state of a device with the command:\n>\nsudo\nip link set\nDEV_NAME\nFor example, to deactivate device eth0, enter\n>\nsudo\nip link set eth0 down\nTo activate it again, use\n>\nsudo\nip link set eth0 up\nTip: Disconnecting NIC device\nIf you deactivate a device with\n>\nsudo\nip link set\nDEV_NAME\ndown\nit disables the network interface on a software level.\nIf you want to simulate losing the link as if the Ethernet cable is unplugged\n     or the connected switch is turned off, run\n>\nsudo\nip link set\nDEV_NAME\ncarrier off\nFor example, while\nip link set\nDEV_NAME\ndown\ndrops all routes using\nDEV_NAME\n,\nip link set DEV carrier\n      off\ndoes not. Be aware that\ncarrier off\nrequires support from the network device driver.\nTo connect the device back to the physical network, run\n>\nsudo\nip link set\nDEV_NAME\ncarrier on\nAfter activating a device, you can configure it. To set the IP address, use\n>\nsudo\nip addr add\nIP_ADDRESS\n+ dev\nDEV_NAME\nFor example, to set the address of the interface eth0 to 192.168.12.154/30\n    with standard broadcast (option\nbrd\n), enter\n>\nsudo\nip addr add 192.168.12.154/30 brd + dev eth0\nTo have a working connection, you must also configure the default gateway.\n    To set a gateway for your system, enter\n>\nsudo\nip route add default via gateway_ip_address\nTo display all devices, use\n>\nsudo\nip link ls\nTo display the running interfaces only, use\n>\nsudo\nip link ls up\nTo print interface statistics for a device, enter\n>\nsudo\nip -s link ls\nDEV_NAME\nTo view additional useful information, specifically about virtual\n     network devices, enter\n>\nsudo\nip -d link ls\nDEV_NAME\nMoreover, to view network layer (IPv4, IPv6) addresses of your devices,\n     enter\n>\nsudo\nip addr\nIn the output, you can find information about MAC addresses of your\n\t\t\t\t\tdevices. To show all routes, use\n>\nsudo\nip route show\nFor more information about using\nip\n, enter\nip\nhelp\nor see the\nman 8 ip\nmanual page. The\nhelp\noption\n    is also available for all\nip\nsubcommands, such as:\n>\nsudo\nip addr help\nFind the\nip\nmanual in\n/usr/share/doc/packages/iproute2/ip-cref.pdf\n.\n23.5.3.2\nTesting a connection with ping\n#\nThe\nping\ncommand is the standard tool for testing\n    whether a TCP/IP connection works. It uses the ICMP protocol to send a\n    small data packet, ECHO_REQUEST datagram, to the destination host,\n    requesting an immediate reply. If this works,\nping\ndisplays a message to that effect. This indicates that the network link is\n    functioning.\nping\ndoes more than only test the function of the\n    connection between two computers: it also provides some basic information\n    about the quality of the connection. In\nExample 23.11, “Output of the command ping”\n, you can see an example of the\nping\noutput. The second-to-last line contains\n    information about the number of transmitted packets, packet loss, and total\n    time of\nping\nrunning.\nAs the destination, you can use a host name or IP address, for example,\nping\nexample.com\nor\nping\n192.168.3.100\n. The program sends\n    packets until you press\nCtrl\n–\nC\n.\nIf you only need to check the functionality of the connection, you can\n    limit the number of the packets with the\n-c\noption. For\n    example to limit ping to three packets, enter\nping\n-c 3 example.com\n.\nExample 23.11:\nOutput of the command ping\n#\nping -c 3 example.com\nPING example.com (192.168.3.100) 56(84) bytes of data.\n64 bytes from example.com (192.168.3.100): icmp_seq=1 ttl=49 time=188 ms\n64 bytes from example.com (192.168.3.100): icmp_seq=2 ttl=49 time=184 ms\n64 bytes from example.com (192.168.3.100): icmp_seq=3 ttl=49 time=183 ms\n--- example.com ping statistics ---\n3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2007ms\nrtt min/avg/max/mdev = 183.417/185.447/188.259/2.052 ms\nThe default interval between two packets is one second. To change the\n    interval, ping provides the option\n-i\n. For example, to\n    increase the ping interval to ten seconds, enter\nping\n-i 10 example.com\n.\nIn a system with multiple network devices, it is sometimes useful to send\n    the ping through a specific interface address. To do so, use the\n-I\noption with the name of the selected device, for\n    example,\nping\n-I wlan1\n    example.com\n.\nFor more options and information about using ping, enter\nping\n-h\nor see the\nping (8)\nman page.\nTip: Pinging IPv6 addresses\nFor IPv6 addresses use the\nping6\ncommand. Note, to ping\n     link-local addresses, you must specify the interface with\n-I\n. The following command works, if the address is\n     reachable via\neth1\n:\nping6 -I eth1 fe80::117:21ff:feda:a425\n23.5.4\nUnit files and start-up scripts\n#\nApart from the configuration files described above, there are also systemd\n   unit files and various scripts that load the network services while the\n   machine is booting. These are started when the system is switched to the\nmulti-user.target\ntarget. Some of these unit files\n   and scripts are described in\nSome unit files and start-up scripts for network programs\n. For\n   more information about\nsystemd\n, see\nChapter 19,\nThe\nsystemd\ndaemon\nand for more information about the\nsystemd\ntargets, see the man page of\nsystemd.special\n(\nman\n   systemd.special\n).\nSome unit files and start-up scripts for network programs\n#\nnetwork.target\nnetwork.target\nis the systemd target for\n      networking, but its mean depends on the settings provided by the system\n      administrator.\nFor more information, see\nhttp://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/NetworkTarget/\n.\nmulti-user.target\nmulti-user.target\nis the systemd target for a\n      multiuser system with all required network services.\nrpcbind\nStarts the rpcbind utility that converts RPC program numbers to universal\n      addresses. It is needed for RPC services, such as an NFS server.\nypserv\nStarts the NIS server.\nypbind\nStarts the NIS client.\n/etc/init.d/nfsserver\nStarts the NFS server.\n/etc/init.d/postfix\nControls the postfix process.\n23.6\nBasic router setup\n#\nA router is a networking device that delivers and receives data (network\n  packets) to or from more than one network back and forth. You often use a\n  router to connect your local network to the remote network (Internet) or to\n  connect local network segments. With\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nyou can build a router with\n  features such as NAT (Network Address Translation) or advanced firewalling.\nThe following are basic steps to turn\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\ninto a router.\nEnable forwarding, for example in\n/etc/sysctl.d/50-router.conf\nnet.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding = 1\nnet.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding = 1\nThen provide a static IPv4 and IPv6 IP setup for the interfaces. Enabling\n    forwarding disables several mechanisms, for example IPv6 does not accept an\n    IPv6 RA (router advertisement) anymore, which also prevents the creation of\n    a default route.\nIn many situations (for example, when you can reach the same network\n    via more than one interface, or when VPN usually is used and already\n    on\n“\nnormal multi-home hosts\n”\n), you must disable the IPv4\n    reverse path filter (this feature does not currently exist for IPv6):\nnet.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 0\nYou can also filter with firewall settings instead.\nTo accept an IPv6 RA (from the router on an external, uplink, or ISP\n    interface) and create a default (or also a more specific) IPv6 route again,\n    set:\nnet.ipv6.conf.${ifname}.accept_ra = 2\nnet.ipv6.conf.${ifname}.autoconf = 0\n(Note:\n“\neth0.42\n”\nneeds to be written as\neth0/42\nin a dot-separated sysfs path.)\nMore router behavior and forwarding dependencies are described in\nhttps://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt\n.\nTo provide IPv6 on your internal (DMZ) interfaces, and announce yourself as\n  an IPv6 router and\n“\nautoconf networks\n”\nto the clients, install\n  and configure\nradvd\nin\n/etc/radvd.conf\n, for example:\ninterface eth0\n{\n    IgnoreIfMissing on;         # do not fail if interface missed\n\n    AdvSendAdvert on;           # enable sending RAs\n    AdvManagedFlag on;          # IPv6 addresses managed via DHCPv6\n    AdvOtherConfigFlag on;      # DNS, NTP... only via DHCPv6\n\n    AdvDefaultLifetime 3600;    # client default route lifetime of 1 hour\n\n    prefix 2001:db8:0:1::/64    # (/64 is default and required for autoconf)\n    {\n        AdvAutonomous off;         # Disable address autoconf (DHCPv6 only)\n\n        AdvValidLifetime 3600;     # prefix (autoconf addr) is valid 1 h\n        AdvPreferredLifetime 1800; # prefix (autoconf addr) is prefered 1/2 h\n    }\n}\nConfigure the firewall to masquerade traffic with NAT from the LAN\n  into the WAN and to block inbound traffic on the WAN interface:\n>\nsudo\nfirewall-cmd\n--permanent --zone=external --change-interface=\nWAN_INTERFACE\n>\nsudo\nfirewall-cmd\n--permanent --zone=external --add-masquerade\n>\nsudo\nfirewall-cmd\n--permanent --zone=internal --change-interface=\nLAN_INTERFACE\n>\nsudo\nfirewall-cmd\n--reload\n23.7\nSetting up bonding devices\n#\nFor some systems, there is a desire to implement network connections that\n  comply to more than the standard data security or availability requirements\n  of a typical Ethernet device. In these cases, several Ethernet devices can be\n  aggregated to a single bonding device.\nThe configuration of the bonding device is done by means of bonding module\n  options. The behavior is mainly affected by the mode of the bonding device.\n  By default, this is\nactive-backup\nwhich means\n  that a different bond port will become active if the active port fails.\n  The following bonding modes are available:\n0\n(balance-rr)\nPackets are transmitted in round-robin fashion from the first to the last\n     available interface. Provides fault tolerance and load balancing.\n1\n(active-backup)\nOnly one network interface is active. If it fails, a different interface\n     becomes active. This setting is the default for\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n. Provides\n     fault tolerance.\n2\n(balance-xor)\nTraffic is split between all available interfaces based on the number of\n     devices included in the bonding. It requires support from the switch.\n     Provides fault tolerance and load balancing.\n3\n(broadcast)\nAll traffic is broadcast on all interfaces. Requires support from the\n     switch. Provides fault tolerance.\n4\n(802.3ad)\nAggregates interfaces into groups that share the same speed and duplex\n     settings. Requires\nethtool\nsupport in the interface\n     drivers, and a switch that supports and is configured for IEEE 802.3ad\n     Dynamic link aggregation. Provides fault tolerance and load balancing.\n5\n(balance-tlb)\nAdaptive transmit load balancing. Requires\nethtool\nsupport in the interface drivers but not switch support. Provides fault\n     tolerance and load balancing.\n6\n(balance-alb)\nAdaptive load balancing. Requires\nethtool\nsupport in\n     the interface drivers but not switch support. Provides fault tolerance and\n     load balancing.\nFor a more detailed description of the modes, see\nhttps://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/bonding.txt\n.\nTip: Bonding and Xen\nUsing bonding devices is only of interest for machines where you have\n   multiple real network cards available. In most configurations, this means\n   that you should use the bonding configuration only in Dom0. Only if you\n   have multiple network cards assigned to a VM Guest system it may also be\n   useful to set up the bond in a VM Guest.\nNote: \n   IBM POWER: Bonding modes 5 and 6 (balance-tlb / balance-alb) unsupported\n   by ibmveth\nThere is a conflict with the tlb/alb bonding configuration and Power\n   firmware.  In short, the bonding driver in tlb/alb mode sends Ethernet\n   Loopback packets with both the source and destination MAC addresses listed\n   as the Virtual Ethernet MAC address. These packets are not supported by\n   Power firmware. Therefore bonding modes 5 and 6 are unsupported by ibmveth.\nTo configure a bonding device, use the following procedure:\nRun\nYaST\n›\nSystem\n›\nNetwork Settings\n.\nUse\nAdd\nand change the\nDevice Type\nto\nBond\n. Proceed with\nNext\n.\nSelect how to assign the IP address to the bonding device. Three methods\n    are at your disposal:\nNo IP Address\nDynamic Address (with DHCP or Zeroconf)\nStatically assigned IP Address\nUse the method that is appropriate for your environment.\nIn the\nBond Ports\ntab, select the Ethernet devices that\n    should be included into the bond by activating the related check box.\nEdit the\nBond Driver Options\nand choose a bonding mode.\nMake sure that the parameter\nmiimon=100\nis added to the\nBond Driver Options\n. Without this parameter, the data\n    integrity is not checked regularly.\nClick\nNext\nand leave YaST with\nOK\nto create the device.\n23.7.1\nHotplugging of bond ports\n#\nIn specific network environments (such as High Availability), there are\n   cases when you need to replace a bond port interface with another one.\n   The reason may be a constantly failing network device. The solution is to\n   set up hotplugging of bond ports.\nThe bond is configured as usual (according to\nman 5\n   ifcfg-bonding\n), for example:\nifcfg-bond0\n          STARTMODE='auto' # or 'onboot'\n          BOOTPROTO='static'\n          IPADDR='192.168.0.1/24'\n          BONDING_MASTER='yes'\n          BONDING_SLAVE_0='eth0'\n          BONDING_SLAVE_1='eth1'\n          BONDING_MODULE_OPTS='mode=active-backup miimon=100'\nThe bond ports are specified with\nSTARTMODE=hotplug\nand\nBOOTPROTO=none\n:\nifcfg-eth0\n          STARTMODE='hotplug'\n          BOOTPROTO='none'\n\nifcfg-eth1\n          STARTMODE='hotplug'\n          BOOTPROTO='none'\nBOOTPROTO=none\nuses the\nethtool\noptions (when provided), but does not set the link up on\nifup\n   eth0\n. The reason is that the bond port interface is controlled by the\n   bond device.\nSTARTMODE=hotplug\ncauses the bond port interface to join the\n   bond automatically when it is available.\nThe\nudev\nrules in\n/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules\nneed to be\n   changed to match the device by bus ID (udev\nKERNELS\nkeyword equal to \"SysFS BusID\" as visible in\nhwinfo\n   --netcard\n) instead of by MAC address. This allows replacement of\n   defective hardware (a network card in the same slot but with a different\n   MAC) and prevents confusion when the bond changes the MAC address of all its\n   bond ports.\nFor example:\nSUBSYSTEM==\"net\", ACTION==\"add\", DRIVERS==\"?*\",\nKERNELS==\"0000:00:19.0\", ATTR{dev_id}==\"0x0\", ATTR{type}==\"1\",\nKERNEL==\"eth*\", NAME=\"eth0\"\nAt boot time, the systemd\nnetwork.service\ndoes not\n   wait for the hotplug bond ports, but for the bond to become ready, which\n   requires at least one available bond port. When one of the bond port interfaces gets\n   removed (unbind from NIC driver,\nrmmod\nof the NIC driver\n   or true PCI hotplug remove) from the system, the kernel removes it from the\n   bond automatically. When a new card is added to the system (replacement of\n   the hardware in the slot),\nudev\nrenames it using\n   the bus-based persistent name rule to the name of the bond port, and calls\nifup\nfor it. The\nifup\ncall\n   automatically joins it into the bond.\n23.8\nSetting up team devices for Network Teaming\n#\nThe term\n“\nlink aggregation\n”\nis the general term which describes\n  combining (or aggregating) a network connection to provide a logical layer.\n  Sometimes you find the terms\n“\nchannel teaming\n”\n,\n“\nEthernet\n  bonding\n”\n,\n“\nport trunking\n”\n, etc. which are synonyms and\n  refer to the same concept.\nThis concept is widely known as\n“\nbonding\n”\nand was originally\n  integrated into the Linux kernel (see\nSection 23.7, “Setting up bonding devices”\nfor the\n  original implementation). The term\nNetwork Teaming\nis used to\n  refer to the new implementation of this concept.\nThe main difference between bonding and Network Teaming is that teaming supplies a\n  set of small kernel modules responsible for providing an interface\n  for teamd instances. Everything else is handled in user space. This is\n  different from the original bonding implementation which contains all of its\n  functionality exclusively in the kernel. For a comparison refer to\nTable 23.5, “Feature comparison between bonding and team”\n.\nTable 23.5:\nFeature comparison between bonding and team\n#\nFeature\nBonding\nTeam\nbroadcast, round-robin TX policy\nyes\nyes\nactive-backup TX policy\nyes\nyes\nLACP (802.3ad) support\nyes\nyes\nhash-based TX policy\nyes\nyes\nuser can set hash function\nno\nyes\nTX load-balancing support (TLB)\nyes\nyes\nTX load-balancing support for LACP\nno\nyes\nEthtool link monitoring\nyes\nyes\nARP link monitoring\nyes\nyes\nNS/NA (IPV6) link monitoring\nno\nyes\nRCU locking on TX/RX paths\nno\nyes\nport prio and stickiness\nno\nyes\nseparate per-port link monitoring setup\nno\nyes\nmultiple link monitoring setup\nlimited\nyes\nVLAN support\nyes\nyes\nmultiple device stacking\nyes\nyes\nSource:\nhttp://libteam.org/files/teamdev.pp.pdf\nBoth implementations, bonding and Network Teaming, can be used in\n  parallel. Network Teaming is an alternative to the existing bonding\n  implementation. It does not replace bonding.\nNetwork Teaming can be used for different use cases. The two most important use\n  cases are explained later and involve:\nLoad balancing between different network devices.\nFailover from one network device to another in case one of the devices\n    should fail.\nCurrently, there is no YaST module to support creating a teaming device.\n  You need to configure Network Teaming manually. The general procedure is shown\n  below which can be applied for all your Network Teaming configurations:\nProcedure 23.1:\nGeneral procedure\n#\nInstall the package\nlibteam-tools\n:\n>\nsudo\nzypper in libteam-tools\nCreate a configuration file under\n/etc/sysconfig/network/\n. Usually it will be\nifcfg-team0\n. If you need more than one Network Teaming\n    device, give them ascending numbers.\nThis configuration file contains several variables which are explained in\n    the man pages (see\nman ifcfg\nand\nman\n    ifcfg-team\n). An example configuration can be found in your\n    system in the file\n/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg.template\n.\nRemove the configuration files of the interfaces which will be used for the\n    teaming device (usually\nifcfg-eth0\nand\nifcfg-eth1\n).\nIt is recommended to make a backup and remove both files. Wicked will\n    re-create the configuration files with the necessary parameters for\n    teaming.\nOptionally, check if everything is included in Wicked's configuration file:\n>\nsudo\nwicked show-config\nStart the Network Teaming device\nteam0\n:\n>\nsudo\nwicked ifup team0\nIn case you need additional debug information, use the option\n--debug all\nafter the\nall\nsubcommand.\nCheck the status of the Network Teaming device. This can be done by the following\n    commands:\nGet the state of the teamd instance from Wicked:\n>\nsudo\nwicked ifstatus --verbose team0\nGet the state of the entire instance:\n>\nsudo\nteamdctl team0 state\nGet the systemd state of the teamd instance:\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl status teamd@team0\nEach of them shows a slightly different view depending on your needs.\nIn case you need to change something in the\nifcfg-team0\nfile afterward, reload its configuration\n    with:\n>\nsudo\nwicked ifreload team0\nDo\nnot\nuse\nsystemctl\nfor starting or\n  stopping the teaming device! Instead, use the\nwicked\ncommand as shown above.\nTo completely remove the team device, use this procedure:\nProcedure 23.2:\nRemoving a team device\n#\nStop the Network Teaming device\nteam0\n:\n>\nsudo\nwicked ifdown team0\nRename the file\n/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-team0\nto\n/etc/sysconfig/network/.ifcfg-team0\n.\n    Inserting a dot in front of the file name makes it\n“\ninvisible\n”\nfor wicked. If you really do not need the\n    configuration anymore, you can also remove the file.\nReload the configuration:\n>\nsudo\nwicked ifreload all\n23.8.1\nUse case: load balancing with Network Teaming\n#\nLoad balancing is used to improve bandwidth. Use the following configuration\n   file to create a Network Teaming device with load balancing capabilities. Proceed\n   with\nProcedure 23.1, “General procedure”\nto set up the device. Check the\n   output with\nteamdctl\n.\nExample 23.12:\nConfiguration for load balancing with Network Teaming\n#\nSTARTMODE=auto\n1\nBOOTPROTO=static\n2\nIPADDRESS=\"192.168.1.1/24\"\n2\nIPADDR6=\"fd00:deca:fbad:50::1/64\"\n2\nTEAM_RUNNER=\"loadbalance\"\n3\nTEAM_LB_TX_HASH=\"ipv4,ipv6,eth,vlan\"\nTEAM_LB_TX_BALANCER_NAME=\"basic\"\nTEAM_LB_TX_BALANCER_INTERVAL=\"100\"\n\nTEAM_PORT_DEVICE_0=\"eth0\"\n4\nTEAM_PORT_DEVICE_1=\"eth1\"\n4\nTEAM_LW_NAME=\"ethtool\"\n5\nTEAM_LW_ETHTOOL_DELAY_UP=\"10\"\n6\nTEAM_LW_ETHTOOL_DELAY_DOWN=\"10\"\n6\n1\nControls the start of the teaming device. The value of\nauto\nmeans, the interface will be set up when the\n      network service is available and will be started automatically on every\n      reboot.\nIn case you need to control the device yourself (and prevent it from\n      starting automatically), set\nSTARTMODE\nto\nmanual\n.\n2\nSets a static IP address (here\n192.168.1.1\nfor IPv4 and\nfd00:deca:fbad:50::1\nfor\n      IPv6).\nIf the Network Teaming device should use a dynamic IP address, set\nBOOTPROTO=\"dhcp\"\nand remove (or comment) the line with\nIPADDRESS\nand\nIPADDR6\n.\n3\nSets\nTEAM_RUNNER\nto\nloadbalance\nto\n      activate the load balancing mode.\n4\nSpecifies one or more devices which should be aggregated to create the\n      Network Teaming device.\n5\nDefines a link watcher to monitor the state of subordinate devices. The\n      default value\nethtool\nchecks only if the device is up\n      and accessible. This makes this check fast enough. However, it does not\n      check if the device can really send or receive packets.\nIf you need a higher confidence in the connection, use the\narp_ping\noption. This sends pings to an arbitrary host\n      (configured in the\nTEAM_LW_ARP_PING_TARGET_HOST\nvariable). The Network Teaming device is considered to be up only if the\n      replies are received.\n6\nDefines the delay in milliseconds between the link coming up (or down)\n      and the runner being notified.\n23.8.2\nUse case: failover with Network Teaming\n#\nFailover is used to ensure high availability of a critical Network Teaming device\n   by involving a parallel backup network device. The backup network device is\n   running all the time and takes over if and when the main device fails.\nUse the following configuration file to create a Network Teaming device with\n   failover capabilities. Proceed with\nProcedure 23.1, “General procedure”\nto\n   set up the device. Check the output with\nteamdctl\n.\nExample 23.13:\nConfiguration for DHCP Network Teaming device\n#\nSTARTMODE=auto\n1\nBOOTPROTO=static\n2\nIPADDR=\"192.168.1.2/24\"\n2\nIPADDR6=\"fd00:deca:fbad:50::2/64\"\n2\nTEAM_RUNNER=activebackup\n3\nTEAM_PORT_DEVICE_0=\"eth0\"\n4\nTEAM_PORT_DEVICE_1=\"eth1\"\n4\nTEAM_LW_NAME=ethtool\n5\nTEAM_LW_ETHTOOL_DELAY_UP=\"10\"\n6\nTEAM_LW_ETHTOOL_DELAY_DOWN=\"10\"\n6\n1\nControls the start of the teaming device.

The\n      default value\nethtool\nchecks only if the device is up\n      and accessible. This makes this check fast enough. However, it does not\n      check if the device can really send or receive packets.\nIf you need a higher confidence in the connection, use the\narp_ping\noption. This sends pings to an arbitrary host\n      (configured in the\nTEAM_LW_ARP_PING_TARGET_HOST\nvariable). Only if the replies are received, the Network Teaming device is\n      considered to be up.\n6\nDefines the delay in milliseconds between the link coming up (or down)\n      and the runner being notified.\n23.8.3\nUse case: VLAN over team device\n#\nVLAN is an abbreviation of\nVirtual Local Area Network\n.\n   It allows the running of multiple\nlogical\n(virtual)\n   Ethernets over one single physical Ethernet. It logically splits the\n   network into different broadcast domains so that packets are only switched\n   between ports that are designated for the same VLAN.\nThe following use case creates two static VLANs on top of a team device:\nvlan0\n,\n      bound to the IP address\n192.168.10.1\nvlan1\n,\n      bound to the IP address\n192.168.20.1\nProceed as follows:\nEnable the VLAN tags on your switch. To use load balancing\n     for your team device, your switch needs to be capable of\nLink Aggregation Control Protocol\n(LACP) (802.3ad).\n     Consult your hardware manual about the details.\nDecide if you want to use load balancing or failover for your team device.\n     Set up your team device as described in\nSection 23.8.1, “Use case: load balancing with Network Teaming”\nor\nSection 23.8.2, “Use case: failover with Network Teaming”\n.\nIn\n/etc/sysconfig/network\ncreate a file\nifcfg-vlan0\nwith the following content:\nSTARTMODE=\"auto\"\nBOOTPROTO=\"static\"\n1\nIPADDR='192.168.10.1/24'\n2\nETHERDEVICE=\"team0\"\n3\nVLAN_ID=\"0\"\n4\nVLAN='yes'\n1\nDefines a fixed IP address, specified in\nIPADDR\n.\n2\nDefines the IP address, here with its netmask.\n3\nContains the real interface to use for the VLAN interface, here our\n       team device (\nteam0\n).\n4\nSpecifies a unique ID for the VLAN.

This means that the functions previously fulfilled by a\n  single, usually inflexible switch can now be separated between a switch (data\n  plane) and its controller (control plane). In this model, the controller is\n  programmable and can be very flexible and adapt quickly to changing network\n  conditions.\nOpen vSwitch\nis software that implements a distributed virtual multilayer switch\n  that is compatible with the\nOpenFlow\nprotocol.\nOpenFlow\nallows a controller application\n  to modify the configuration of a switch.\nOpenFlow\nis layered onto the TCP protocol\n  and is implemented in a range of hardware and software. A single controller\n  can thus drive multiple, very different switches.\n23.9.1\nAdvantages of\nOpen vSwitch\n#\nSoftware-defined networking with\nOpen vSwitch\nbrings several advantages with it,\n   especially when you used together with virtual machines:\nNetworking states can be identified easily.\nNetworks and their live state can be moved from one host to another.\nNetwork dynamics are traceable and external software can be enabled to\n     respond to them.\nYou can apply and manipulate tags in network packets to identify which\n     machine they are coming from or going to and maintain other networking\n     context.  Tagging rules can be configured and migrated.\nOpen vSwitch\nimplements the GRE protocol (\nGeneric Routing\n     Encapsulation\n). This allows you, for example, to connect\n     private VM networks to each other.\nOpen vSwitch\ncan be used on its own, but is designed to integrate with networking\n     hardware and can control hardware switches.\n23.9.2\nInstalling\nOpen vSwitch\n#\nInstall\nOpen vSwitch\nand supplementary packages:\n#\nzypper\ninstall openvswitch openvswitch-switch\nIf you plan to use\nOpen vSwitch\ntogether with the KVM hypervisor, additionally\n     install\ntunctl\n. If you plan to use\nOpen vSwitch\ntogether with the Xen hypervisor,\n     additionally install\nopenvswitch-kmp-xen\n.\nEnable the\nOpen vSwitch\nservice:\n#\nsystemctl\nenable openvswitch\nEither restart the computer or use\nsystemctl\nto start\n     the\nOpen vSwitch\nservice immediately:\n#\nsystemctl\nstart openvswitch\nTo check whether\nOpen vSwitch\nwas activated correctly, use:\n#\nsystemctl\nstatus openvswitch\n23.9.3\nOverview of\nOpen vSwitch\ndaemons and utilities\n#\nOpen vSwitch\nconsists of several components. Among them are a kernel module and\n   various user space components. The kernel module is used for accelerating\n   the data path, but is not necessary for a minimal\nOpen vSwitch\ninstallation.\n23.9.3.1\nDaemons\n#\nThe central executables of\nOpen vSwitch\nare its two daemons. When you start the\nopenvswitch\nservice, you are indirectly starting\n    them.\nThe main\nOpen vSwitch\ndaemon (\novs-vswitchd\n) provides the\n    implementation of a switch. The\nOpen vSwitch\ndatabase daemon\n    (\novsdb-server\n) serves the database that stores the\n    configuration and state of\nOpen vSwitch\n.\n23.9.3.2\nUtilities\n#\nOpen vSwitch\nalso comes with several utilities that help you work with it. The\n    following list is not exhaustive, but instead describes important commands\n    only.\novsdb-tool\nCreate, upgrade, compact, and query\nOpen vSwitch\ndatabases. Do transactions on\nOpen vSwitch\ndatabases.\novs-appctl\nConfigure a running\novs-vswitchd\nor\novsdb-server\ndaemon.\novs-dpctl\n,\novs-dpctl-top\nCreate, modify, visualize, and delete data paths. Using this tool can\n       interfere with\novs-vswitchd\nalso performing data path\n       management. Therefore, it is often used for diagnostics only.\novs-dpctl-top\ncreates a\ntop\n-like\n       visualization for data paths.\novs-ofctl\nManage any switches adhering to the\nOpenFlow\nprotocol.\novs-ofctl\nis not limited to interacting with\nOpen vSwitch\n.\novs-vsctl\nProvides a high-level interface to the configuration database. It can be\n       used to query and modify the database. In effect, it shows the status of\novs-vswitchd\nand can be used to configure it.\n23.9.4\nCreating a bridge with\nOpen vSwitch\n#\nThe following example configuration uses the Wicked network service that is\n   used by default on\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n. To learn more about Wicked, see\nSection 23.5, “Configuring a network connection manually”\n.\nWhen you have installed and started\nOpen vSwitch\n, proceed as follows:\nTo configure a bridge for use by your virtual machine, create a file with\n     content like this:\nSTARTMODE='auto'\n1\nBOOTPROTO='dhcp'\n2\nOVS_BRIDGE='yes'\n3\nOVS_BRIDGE_PORT_DEVICE_1='\neth0\n'\n4\n1\nSet up the bridge automatically when the network service is started.\n2\nThe protocol to use for configuring the IP address.\n3\nMark the configuration as an\nOpen vSwitch\nbridge.\n4\nChoose which device/devices should be added to the bridge. To add more\n       devices, append additional lines for each of them to the file:\nOVS_BRIDGE_PORT_DEVICE_\nSUFFIX\n='\nDEVICE\n'\nThe\nSUFFIX\ncan be any alphanumeric string.\n       However, to avoid overwriting a previous definition, make sure the\nSUFFIX\nof each device is unique.\nSave the file in the directory\n/etc/sysconfig/network\nunder the name\nifcfg-br0\n. Instead of\nbr0\n, you can use any name you want. However,\n     the file name needs to begin with\nifcfg-\n.\nTo learn about further options, refer to the man pages of\nifcfg\n(\nman 5 ifcfg\n) and\nifcfg-ovs-bridge\n(\nman 5\n     ifcfg-ovs-bridge\n).\nNow start the bridge:\n#\nwicked\nifup\nbr0\nWhen Wicked is done, it should output the name of the bridge and next to\n     it the state\nup\n.\n23.9.5\nUsing\nOpen vSwitch\ndirectly with KVM\n#\nAfter having created the bridge as described in\nSection 23.9.4, “Creating a bridge with\nOpen vSwitch\n”\n, you can use\nOpen vSwitch\nto manage the network\n   access of virtual machines created with KVM/QEMU.\nTo be able to best use the capabilities of Wicked, make some further\n     changes to the bridge configured before. Open the previously created\n/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-br0\nand append a line\n     for another port device:\nOVS_BRIDGE_PORT_DEVICE_2='\ntap0\n'\nAdditionally, set\nBOOTPROTO\nto\nnone\n.\n     The file should now look like this:\nSTARTMODE='auto'\nBOOTPROTO='none'\nOVS_BRIDGE='yes'\nOVS_BRIDGE_PORT_DEVICE_1='\neth0\n'\nOVS_BRIDGE_PORT_DEVICE_2='\ntap0\n'\nThe new port device\ntap0\nwill be configured in\n     the next step.\nNow add a configuration file for the\ntap0\ndevice:\nSTARTMODE='auto'\nBOOTPROTO='none'\nTUNNEL='tap'\nSave the file in the directory\n/etc/sysconfig/network\nunder the name\nifcfg-tap0\n.\nTip: Allowing other users to access the tap device\nTo be able to use this tap device from a virtual machine started as a\n      user who is not\nroot\n, append:\nTUNNEL_SET_OWNER=\nUSER_NAME\nTo allow access for an entire group, append:\nTUNNEL_SET_GROUP=\nGROUP_NAME\nFinally, open the configuration for the device defined as the first\nOVS_BRIDGE_PORT_DEVICE\n. If you did not change the name,\n     that should be\neth0\n. Therefore, open\n/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eth0\nand make sure that\n     the following options are set:\nSTARTMODE='auto'\nBOOTPROTO='none'\nIf the file does not exist yet, create it.\nRestart the bridge interface using Wicked:\n#\nwicked\nifreload\nbr0\nThis will also trigger a reload of the newly defined bridge port devices.\nTo start a virtual machine, use, for example:\n#\nqemu-kvm\n\\\n-drive file=\n/PATH/TO/DISK-IMAGE\n1\n\\\n-m 512 -net nic,vlan=0,macaddr=00:11:22:EE:EE:EE \\\n-net tap,ifname=\ntap0\n,script=no,downscript=no\n2\n1\nThe path to the QEMU disk image you want to start.\n2\nUse the tap device (\ntap0\n) created before.\nFor further information on the usage of KVM/QEMU, see\nPart V, “Managing virtual machines with QEMU”\n.\n23.9.6\nUsing\nOpen vSwitch\nwith\nlibvirt\n#\nAfter having created the bridge as described before in\nSection 23.9.4, “Creating a bridge with\nOpen vSwitch\n”\n, you can add the bridge to an existing\n   virtual machine managed with\nlibvirt\n. Since\nlibvirt\nhas some support for\nOpen vSwitch\nbridges already, you can use the bridge created in\nSection 23.9.4, “Creating a bridge with\nOpen vSwitch\n”\nwithout further changes to the networking\n   configuration.\nOpen the domain XML file for the intended virtual machine:\n#\nvirsh\nedit\nVM_NAME\nReplace\nVM_NAME\nwith the name of the desired\n     virtual machine. This will open your default text editor.\nFind the networking section of the document by looking for a section\n     starting with\n<interface type=\"...\">\nand ending\n     in\n</interface>\n.\nReplace the existing section with a networking section that looks somewhat\n     like this:\n<interface type='bridge'>\n  <source bridge='br0'/>\n  <virtualport type='openvswitch'/>\n</interface>\nImportant: Compatibility of\nvirsh iface-*\nand Virtual Machine Manager with\nOpen vSwitch\nAt the moment, the\nOpen vSwitch\ncompatibility of\nlibvirt\nis not exposed\n      through the\nvirsh iface-*\ntools and Virtual Machine Manager. If you use\n      any of these tools, your configuration can break.\nYou can now start or restart the virtual machine as usual.\nFor further information on the usage of\nlibvirt\n, see\nPart II, “Managing virtual machines with\nlibvirt\n”\n.\n23.9.7\nMore information\n#\nFor more information on SDN, refer to the documentation section of the\nOpen vSwitch\nproject Web site at\nhttps://docs.openvswitch.org/en/latest/#documentation\n.\nOn this page\n23.1\nIP addresses and routing\n23.2\nIPv6—the next generation Internet\n23.3\nName resolution\n23.4\nConfiguring a network connection with YaST\n23.5\nConfiguring a network connection manually\n23.6\nBasic router setup\n23.7\nSetting up bonding devices\n23.8\nSetting up team devices for Network Teaming\n23.9\nSoftware-defined networking with\nOpen vSwitch\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

Printers can be configured manually or with YaST.\n  For configuration instructions, refer to\nChapter 34,\nSetting up a printer\n.\n  Both graphical and command line utilities are available for starting and\n  managing print jobs. If your printer does not work as expected, refer to\nSection 24.8, “Troubleshooting”\n.\nCUPS (Common Unix Printing System) is the standard print system in\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n.\nPrinters can be distinguished by interface, such as USB or network, and\n  printer language. When buying a printer, make sure that the printer has an\n  interface that is supported (USB, Ethernet, or Wi-Fi) and a suitable printer\n  language. Printers can be categorized on the basis of the following three\n  classes of printer languages:\nPostScript printers\nPostScript is the printer language in which most print jobs in Linux and\n     Unix are generated and processed by the internal print system. If\n     PostScript documents can be processed directly by the printer and do not\n     need to be converted in additional stages in the print system, the number\n     of potential error sources is reduced.\nCurrently PostScript is being replaced by PDF as the standard print job\n     format. PostScript+PDF printers that can directly print PDF (in addition\n     to PostScript) already exist. For traditional PostScript printers PDF\n     needs to be converted to PostScript in the printing workflow.\nStandard printers (languages like PCL and ESC/p)\nIn the case of known printer languages, the print system can convert\n     PostScript jobs to the respective printer language with Ghostscript. This\n     processing stage is called interpreting. The best-known languages are PCL\n     (which is mostly used by HP printers and their clones) and ESC/P (which is\n     used by Epson printers). These printer languages are usually supported by\n     Linux and produce an adequate print result. Linux may not be able to\n     address some special printer functions. Except for HP and Epson, there are\n     currently no printer manufacturers who develop Linux drivers and make them\n     available to Linux distributors under an open source license.\nProprietary printers (also called GDI printers)\nThese printers do not support any of the common printer languages. They\n     use their own undocumented printer languages, which are subject to change\n     when a new edition of a model is released. Usually only Windows drivers\n     are available for these printers. See\nSection 24.8.1, “Printers without standard printer language support”\nfor more information.\nBefore you buy a new printer, refer to the following sources to check how\n  well the printer you intend to buy is supported:\nhttp://www.openprinting.org/printers\nThe OpenPrinting home page with the printer database. The database shows\n     the latest Linux support status. However, a Linux distribution can only\n     integrate the drivers available at production time. Accordingly, a printer\n     currently rated as\n“\nperfectly supported\n”\nmay not have had\n     this status when the latest\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nversion was released. Thus, the\n     databases may not necessarily indicate the correct status, but only\n     provide an approximation.\nhttps://www.ghostscript.com\nThe Ghostscript Web page.\n/usr/share/doc/packages/ghostscript/catalog.devices\nList of built-in Ghostscript drivers.\n24.1\nThe CUPS workflow\n#\nThe user creates a print job. The print job consists of the data to print\n   plus information for the spooler. This includes the name of the printer or the\n   name of the print queue, and optionally, information for the filter, such as\n   printer-specific options.\nAt least one dedicated print queue exists for every printer. The spooler\n   holds the print job in the queue until the desired printer is ready to\n   receive data. When the printer is ready, the spooler sends the data through\n   the filter and back-end to the printer.\nThe filter converts the data generated by the application that is printing\n   (usually PostScript or PDF, but also ASCII, JPEG, etc.) into\n   printer-specific data (PostScript, PCL, ESC/P, etc.). The features of the\n   printer are described in the PPD files. A PPD file contains printer-specific\n   options with the parameters needed to enable them on the printer. The filter\n   system makes sure that options selected by the user are enabled.\nIf you use a PostScript printer, the filter system converts the data into\n   printer-specific PostScript. This does not require a printer driver. If you\n   use a non-PostScript printer, the filter system converts the data into\n   printer-specific data. This requires a printer driver suitable for your\n   printer. The back-end receives the printer-specific data from the filter\n   then passes it to the printer.\n24.2\nMethods and protocols for connecting printers\n#\nThere are various possibilities for connecting a printer to the system. The\n   configuration of CUPS does not distinguish between a local printer and a\n   printer connected to the system over the network. For more information about\n   the printer connection, read the article\nCUPS in a\n   Nutshell\nat\nhttps://en.opensuse.org/SDB:CUPS_in_a_Nutshell\n.\nIBM Z\nPrinters and similar devices provided by the z/VM that connect locally with\n   the IBM Z mainframes are not supported by CUPS. On these platforms,\n   printing is only possible over the network. The cabling for network printers\n   must be installed according to the instructions of the printer manufacturer.\nWarning: Changing cable connections in a running system\nWhen connecting the printer to the machine, do not forget that only USB\n    devices can be plugged in or unplugged during operation. To avoid damaging\n    your system or printer, shut down the system before changing any\n    connections that are not USB.\n24.3\nInstalling the software\n#\nPPD (PostScript printer description) is the computer language that describes\n   the properties, like resolution, and options, such as the availability of a\n   duplex unit. These descriptions are required for using various printer\n   options in CUPS. Without a PPD file, the print data would be forwarded to\n   the printer in a\n“\nraw\n”\nstate, which is usually not desired.\nTo configure a PostScript printer, the best approach is to get a suitable\n   PPD file. Many PPD files are available in the packages\nmanufacturer-PPDs\nand\nOpenPrintingPPDs-postscript\n. See\nSection 24.7.3, “PPD files in various packages”\nand\nSection 24.8.2, “No suitable PPD file available for a PostScript printer”\n.\nNew PPD files can be stored in the directory\n/usr/share/cups/model/\nor added to the print system\n   with YaST as described in\nSection 34.1.1, “Adding drivers with YaST”\n.\n   Subsequently, the PPD file can be selected during the printer setup.\nBe careful if a printer manufacturer wants you to install entire software\n   packages. This kind of installation may result in the loss of the\n   support provided by\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n. Also, print commands may work\n   differently and the system may no longer be able to address devices of other\n   manufacturers. For this reason, the installation of manufacturer software is\n   not recommended.\n24.4\nNetwork printers\n#\nA network printer can support various protocols, some even concurrently.\n   Although most of the supported protocols are standardized, some\n   manufacturers modify the standard. Manufacturers then provide drivers for\n   only a few operating systems. Unfortunately, Linux drivers are rarely\n   provided. The current situation is such that you cannot act on the\n   assumption that every protocol works smoothly in Linux. Therefore, you may\n   need to experiment with various options to achieve a functional\n   configuration.\nCUPS supports the\nsocket\n,\nLPD\n,\nIPP\nand\nsmb\nprotocols.\nsocket\nSocket\nrefers to a connection in which the plain\n      print data is sent directly to a TCP socket. Some socket port numbers\n      that are commonly used are\n9100\nor\n35\n.\n      The device URI (uniform resource identifier) syntax is:\n      socket://\nIP.OF.THE.PRINTER\n:\nPORT\n,\n      for example:\nsocket://192.168.2.202:9100/\n.\nLPD (line printer daemon)\nThe LPD protocol is described in RFC 1179. Under this protocol, some\n      job-related data, such as the ID of the print queue, is sent before the\n      actual print data is sent. Therefore, a print queue must be specified\n      when configuring the LPD protocol. The implementations of diverse printer\n      manufacturers are flexible enough to accept any name as the print queue.\n      If necessary, the printer manual should indicate what name to use. LPT,\n      LPT1, LP1 or similar names are often used. The port number for an LPD\n      service is\n515\n. An example device URI is\nlpd://192.168.2.202/LPT1\n.\nIPP (Internet printing protocol)\nIPP is based on the HTTP protocol. With\n      IPP, more job-related data is transmitted than with the other protocols.\n      CUPS uses IPP for internal data transmission. The name of the print queue\n      is necessary to configure IPP correctly. The port number for IPP is\n631\n. Example device URIs are\nipp://192.168.2.202/ps\nand\nipp://192.168.2.202/printers/ps\n.\nSMB (Windows share)\nCUPS also supports printing on printers connected to Windows shares. The\n      protocol used for this purpose is SMB. SMB uses the port numbers\n137\n,\n138\nand\n139\n.\n      Example device URIs are\nsmb://user:password@workgroup/smb.example.com/printer\n,\nsmb://user:password@smb.example.com/printer\n, and\nsmb://smb.example.com/printer\n.\nThe protocol supported by the printer must be determined before\n   configuration. If the manufacturer does not provide the needed information,\n   the command\nnmap\n(which comes with the\nnmap\npackage) can be used to ascertain the\n   protocol.\nnmap\nchecks a host for open ports. For example:\n>\nnmap -p 35,137-139,515,631,9100-10000\nIP.OF.THE.PRINTER\n24.5\nConfiguring CUPS with command line tools\n#\nCUPS can be configured with command line tools like\nlpinfo\n,\nlpadmin\nand\nlpoptions\n. You need a device URI consisting of a\n   back-end, such as USB, and parameters. To determine valid device URIs on\n   your system use the command\nlpinfo -v | grep \":/\"\n:\n>\nsudo\nlpinfo -v | grep \":/\"\ndirect usb://ACME/FunPrinter%20XL\nnetwork socket://192.168.2.253\nWith\nlpadmin\nthe CUPS server administrator can add,\n   remove or manage print queues. To add a print queue, use the following\n   syntax:\n>\nsudo\nlpadmin -p\nQUEUE\n-v\nDEVICE-URI\n-P\nPPD-FILE\n-E\nThen the device (\n-v\n) is available as\nQUEUE\n(\n-p\n), using the specified\n   PPD file (\n-P\n). This means that you must know the PPD file\n   and the device URI to configure the printer manually.\nDo not use\n-E\nas the first option. For all CUPS commands,\n-E\nas the first argument sets use of an encrypted\n   connection. To enable the printer,\n-E\nmust be used as shown\n   in the following example:\n>\nsudo\nlpadmin -p ps -v usb://ACME/FunPrinter%20XL -P \\\n/usr/share/cups/model/Postscript.ppd.gz -E\nThe following example configures a network printer:\n>\nsudo\nlpadmin -p ps -v socket://192.168.2.202:9100/ -P \\\n/usr/share/cups/model/Postscript-level1.ppd.gz -E\nFor more options of\nlpadmin\n, see the man page of\nlpadmin(8)\n.\nDuring printer setup, certain options are set as default. These options can\n   be modified for every print job (depending on the print tool used). Changing\n   these default options with YaST is also possible. Using command line\n   tools, set default options as follows:\nFirst, list all options:\n>\nsudo\nlpoptions -p\nQUEUE\n-l\nExample:\nResolution/Output Resolution: 150dpi *300dpi 600dpi\nThe activated default option is identified by a preceding asterisk\n     (\n*\n).\nChange the option with\nlpadmin\n:\n>\nsudo\nlpadmin -p\nQUEUE\n-o Resolution=600dpi\nCheck the new setting:\n>\nsudo\nlpoptions -p\nQUEUE\n-l\n\nResolution/Output Resolution: 150dpi 300dpi *600dpi\nWhen a normal user runs\nlpoptions\n, the settings are\n   written to\n~/.cups/lpoptions\n. However,\nroot\nsettings are written to\n/etc/cups/lpoptions\n.\n24.6\nPrinting from the command line\n#\nTo print from the command line, enter\nlp -d\nQUEUENAME\nFILENAME\n,\n   substituting the corresponding names for\nQUEUENAME\nand\nFILENAME\n.\nSome applications rely on the\nlp\ncommand for printing. In\n   this case, enter the correct command in the application's print dialog,\n   usually without specifying\nFILENAME\n, for example,\nlp -d\nQUEUENAME\n.\n24.7\nSpecial features in\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n#\nSeveral CUPS features have been adapted for\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n. Some of the most\n   important changes are covered here.\n24.7.1\nCUPS and firewall\n#\nAfter completing a default installation of\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n,\nfirewalld\nis active and the network interfaces are configured to be in\n    the\npublic\nzone, which blocks incoming traffic.\nWhen\nfirewalld\nis active, you may need to configure it to\n       allow clients to browse network printers by allowing\nmdns\nand\nipp\nthrough\n       the internal network zone. The public zone should never\n       expose printer queues.\n(More\n    information about the\nfirewalld\nconfiguration is available in\nSection 23.4, “\nfirewalld\n”\nand at\nhttps://en.opensuse.org/SDB:CUPS_and_SANE_Firewall_settings\n.)\n24.7.1.1\nCUPS client\n#\nNormally, a CUPS client runs on a regular workstation located in a trusted\n     network environment behind a firewall. In this case it is recommended to\n     configure the network interface to be in the\nInternal\n     Zone\n, so the workstation is reachable from within the network.\n24.7.1.2\nCUPS server\n#\nIf the CUPS server is part of a trusted network environment protected by a\n     firewall, the network interface should be configured to be in the\nInternal Zone\nof the firewall. It is not recommended to\n     set up a CUPS server in an untrusted network environment unless you ensure\n     that it is protected by special firewall rules and secure settings in\n     the CUPS configuration.\n24.7.2\nBrowsing for network printers\n#\nCUPS servers regularly announce the availability and status information of\n    shared printers over the network. Clients can access this information to\n    display a list of available printers in printing dialogs, for example. This\n    is called\n“\nbrowsing\n”\n.\nCUPS servers announce their print queues over the network either via the\n    traditional CUPS browsing protocol, or via Bonjour/DNS-SD. To enable browsing network print queues, the service\ncups-browsed\nneeds to run on all\n    clients that print via CUPS servers.\ncups-browsed\nis not started by\n    default. To start it for the active session, use\nsudo systemctl\n    start cups-browsed\n. To ensure it is automatically started after\n    booting, enable it with\nsudo systemctl enable\n    cups-browsed\non all clients.\nIn case browsing does not work after having started\ncups-browsed\n, the CUPS server(s)\n    probably announce the network print queues via Bonjour/DNS-SD. In this case\n    you need to additionally install the package\navahi\nand start the associated\n    service with\nsudo systemctl start avahi-daemon\non all\n    clients.\nSee\nSection 24.7.1, “CUPS and firewall”\nfor information\n       on allowing printer browsing through\nfirewalld\n.\n24.7.3\nPPD files in various packages\n#\nThe YaST printer configuration sets up the queues for CUPS using the PPD\n    files installed in\n/usr/share/cups/model\n. To find the\n    suitable PPD files for the printer model, YaST compares the vendor and\n    model determined during hardware detection with the vendors and models in\n    all PPD files. For this purpose, the YaST printer configuration generates\n    a database from the vendor and model information extracted from the PPD\n    files.\nThe configuration using only PPD files and no other information sources has\n    the advantage that the PPD files in\n/usr/share/cups/model\ncan be modified freely. For\n    example, if you have PostScript printers the PPD files can be copied\n    directly to\n/usr/share/cups/model\n(if they do not\n    already exist in the\nmanufacturer-PPDs\nor\nOpenPrintingPPDs-postscript\npackages) to achieve\n    an optimum configuration for your printers.\nAdditional PPD files are provided by the following packages:\ngutenprint\n: the Gutenprint driver and its matching PPDs\nsplix\n: the SpliX driver and its matching PPDs\nOpenPrintingPPDs-ghostscript\n: PPDs for Ghostscript built-in drivers\nOpenPrintingPPDs-hpijs\n: PPDs for the HPIJS driver for non-HP printers\n24.8\nTroubleshooting\n#\nThe following sections cover some of the most frequently encountered printer\n   hardware and software problems and ways to solve or circumvent these\n   problems. Among the topics covered are GDI printers, PPD files and port\n   configuration. Common network printer problems, defective printouts, and\n   queue handling are also addressed.\n24.8.1\nPrinters without standard printer language support\n#\nThese printers do not support any common printer language and can only be\n    addressed with special proprietary control sequences. Therefore they can\n    only work with the operating system versions for which the manufacturer\n    delivers a driver. GDI is a programming interface developed by Microsoft*\n    for graphics devices. Usually the manufacturer delivers drivers only for\n    Windows, and since the Windows driver uses the GDI interface these printers\n    are also called\nGDI printers\n. The actual problem is\n    not the programming interface, but that these printers can only be\n    addressed with the proprietary printer language of the respective printer\n    model.\nSome GDI printers can be switched to operate either in GDI mode or in one\n    of the standard printer languages. See the manual of the printer whether\n    this is possible. Some models require special Windows software to do the\n    switch (note that the Windows printer driver may always switch the printer\n    back into GDI mode when printing from Windows). For other GDI printers\n    there are extension modules for a standard printer language available.\nSome manufacturers provide proprietary drivers for their printers. The\n    disadvantage of proprietary printer drivers is that there is no guarantee\n    that these work with the installed print system or that they are suitable\n    for the various hardware platforms. In contrast, printers that support a\n    standard printer language do not depend on a special print system version\n    or a special hardware platform.\nInstead of spending time trying to make a proprietary Linux driver work, it\n    may be more cost-effective to purchase a printer which supports a standard\n    printer language (preferably PostScript). This would solve the driver\n    problem once and for all, eliminating the need to install and configure\n    special driver software and obtain driver updates that may be required\n    because of new developments in the print system.\n24.8.2\nNo suitable PPD file available for a PostScript printer\n#\nIf the\nmanufacturer-PPDs\nor\nOpenPrintingPPDs-postscript\npackages do not\n    contain a suitable PPD file for a PostScript printer, it should be possible\n    to use the PPD file from the driver CD of the printer manufacturer or\n    download a suitable PPD file from the Web page of the printer manufacturer.\nIf the PPD file is provided as a zip archive (.zip) or a self-extracting\n    zip archive (\n.exe\n), unpack it with\nunzip\n. First, review the license terms of the PPD file.\n    Then use the\ncupstestppd\nutility to check if the PPD\n    file complies with\n“\nAdobe PostScript Printer Description File Format\n    Specification, version 4.3.\n”\nIf the utility returns\n“\nFAIL,\n”\nthe errors in the PPD files are serious and are likely\n    to cause major problems. The problem spots reported by\ncupstestppd\nshould be eliminated. If necessary, ask the\n    printer manufacturer for a suitable PPD file.\n24.8.3\nNetwork printer connections\n#\nIdentifying network problems\nConnect the printer directly to the computer. For test purposes,\n       configure the printer as a local printer. If this works, the problems\n       are related to the network.\nChecking the TCP/IP network\nThe TCP/IP network and name resolution must be functional.\nChecking a remote\nlpd\nUse the following command to test if a TCP connection can be established\n       to\nlpd\n(port\n515\n) on\nHOST\n:\n>\nnetcat -z\nHOST\n515 && echo ok || echo failed\nIf the connection to\nlpd\ncannot be established,\nlpd\nmay not be active or there may be basic network\n       problems.\nProvided that the respective\nlpd\nis active and the host accepts queries, run the following command as\nroot\nto query a status report for\nQUEUE\non remote\nHOST\n:\n#\necho -e \"\\004queue\" \\\n| netcat -w 2 -p 722\nHOST\n515\nIf\nlpd\ndoes not respond, it may not be active or\n       there may be basic network problems. If\nlpd\nresponds,\n       the response should show why printing is not possible on the\nqueue\non\nhost\n. If you receive a\n       response like that shown in\nExample 24.1, “Error message from\nlpd\n”\n, the problem is\n       caused by the remote\nlpd\n.\nExample 24.1:\nError message from\nlpd\n#\nlpd: your host does not have line printer access\nlpd: queue does not exist\nprinter: spooling disabled\nprinter: printing disabled\nChecking a remote\ncupsd\nA CUPS network server can broadcast its queues by default every 30\n       seconds on UDP port\n631\n. Accordingly, the following\n       command can be used to test whether there is a broadcasting CUPS network\n       server in the network. Make sure to stop your local CUPS daemon before\n       executing the command.\n>\nnetcat -u -l -p 631 & PID=$! ; sleep 40 ; kill $PID\nIf a broadcasting CUPS network server exists, the output appears as\n       shown in\nExample 24.2, “Broadcast from the CUPS network server”\n.\nExample 24.2:\nBroadcast from the CUPS network server\n#\nipp://192.168.2.202:631/printers/queue\nIBM Z\nTake into account that IBM Z Ethernet devices do not receive\n       broadcasts by default.\nThe following command can be used to test if a TCP connection can be\n       established to\ncupsd\n(port\n631\n) on\nHOST\n:\n>\nnetcat -z\nHOST\n631 && echo ok || echo failed\nIf the connection to\ncupsd\ncannot be established,\ncupsd\nmay not be active or there may be basic network\n       problems.\nlpstat -h\nHOST\n-l -t returns a (possibly very long) status report for all queues on\nHOST\n, provided the respective\ncupsd\nis active and the host accepts queries.\nThe next command can be used to test if the\nQUEUE\non\nHOST\naccepts a print job consisting of a single carriage-return character.\n       Nothing should be printed. Possibly, a blank page may be ejected.\n>\necho -en \"\\r\" \\\n| lp -d queue -h\nHOST\nTroubleshooting a Network Printer or Print Server Machine\nSpoolers running in a print server machine sometimes cause problems when\n       they need to deal with multiple print jobs. Since this is caused by the\n       spooler in the print server machine, there no way to resolve this issue. As\n       a work-around, circumvent the spooler in the print server machine by\n       addressing the printer connected to the print server machine directly with\n       the TCP socket. See\nSection 24.4, “Network printers”\n.\nIn this way, the print server machine is reduced to a converter between the\n       various forms of data transfer (TCP/IP network and local printer\n       connection). To use this method, you need to know the TCP port on the\n       print server machine. If the printer is connected to the print server machine\n       and turned on, this TCP port can usually be determined with the\nnmap\nutility from the\nnmap\npackage some time after the print server machine is powered up. For example,\nnmap\nIP-address\nmay\n       deliver the following output for a print server machine:\nPort       State       Service\n23/tcp     open        telnet\n80/tcp     open        http\n515/tcp    open        printer\n631/tcp    open        cups\n9100/tcp   open        jetdirect\nThis output indicates that the printer connected to the print server machine\n       can be addressed via TCP socket on port\n9100\n. By\n       default,\nnmap\nonly checks several commonly known\n       ports listed in\n/usr/share/nmap/nmap-services\n. To\n       check all possible ports, use the command\nnmap\n       -p\nFROM_PORT\n-\nTO_PORT\nIP_ADDRESS\n.\n       This may take some time. For further information, refer to the man page\n       of\nnmap\n.\nEnter a command like\n>\necho -en \"\\rHello\\r\\f\" | netcat -w 1 IP-address port\ncat file | netcat -w 1 IP-address port\nto send character strings or files directly to the respective port to\n       test if the printer can be addressed on this port.\n24.8.4\nDefective printouts without error message\n#\nFor the print system, the print job is completed when the CUPS back-end\n    completes the data transfer to the recipient (printer). If further\n    processing on the recipient fails (for example, if the printer is not able\n    to print the printer-specific data) the print system does not notice this.\n    If the printer cannot print the printer-specific data, select a PPD file\n    that is more suitable for the printer.\n24.8.5\nDisabled queues\n#\nIf the data transfer to the recipient fails entirely after several\n    attempts, the CUPS back-end, such as\nUSB\nor\nsocket\n, reports an error to the print system (to\ncupsd\n). The back-end determines how many unsuccessful\n    attempts are appropriate until the data transfer is reported as impossible.\n    As further attempts would be in vain,\ncupsd\ndisables\n    printing for the respective queue. After eliminating the cause of the\n    problem, the system administrator must re-enable printing with the command\ncupsenable\n.\n24.8.6\nCUPS browsing: deleting print jobs\n#\nIf a CUPS network server broadcasts its queues to the client hosts via\n    browsing and a suitable local\ncupsd\nis active on the\n    client hosts, the client\ncupsd\naccepts print jobs from\n    applications and forwards them to the\ncupsd\non the\n    server. When\ncupsd\non the server accepts a print job, it\n    is assigned a new job number. Therefore, the job number on the client host\n    is different from the job number on the server. As a print job is usually\n    forwarded immediately, it cannot be deleted with the job number on the\n    client host This is because the client\ncupsd\nregards the\n    print job as completed when it has been forwarded to the server\ncupsd\n.\nTo delete the print job on the server, use a\n    command such as\nlpstat -h cups.example.com -o\nto determine the\n    job number on the server. This assumes that the server has not already\n    completed the print job (that is, sent it completely to the printer). Use\n    the obtained job\n    number to delete the print job on the server as follows:\n>\ncancel -h cups.example.com\nQUEUE-JOBNUMBER\n24.8.7\nDefective print jobs and data transfer errors\n#\nIf you switch the printer off or shut down the computer during the printing\n    process, print jobs remain in the queue. Printing resumes when the computer\n    (or the printer) is switched back on. Defective print jobs must be removed\n    from the queue with\ncancel\n.\nIf a print job is corrupted or an error occurs in the communication between\n    the host and the printer, the printer cannot process the data correctly and\n    prints numerous sheets of paper with\n    unintelligible characters. To\n    fix the problem, follow these steps:\nTo stop printing, remove all paper from ink jet printers or open the\n      paper trays of laser printers. High-quality printers have a button for\n      canceling the current printout.\nThe print job may still be in the queue, because jobs are only removed\n      after they are sent completely to the printer. Use\nlpstat\n      -o\nor\nlpstat -h cups.example.com -o\nto check which\n      queue is currently printing. Delete the print job with\ncancel\nQUEUE\n-\nJOBNUMBER\nor\ncancel -h cups.example.com\nQUEUE\n-\nJOBNUMBER\n.\nSome data may still be transferred to the printer even though the print\n      job has been deleted from the queue. Check if a CUPS back-end process is\n      still running for the respective queue and terminate it.\nReset the printer completely by switching it off for some time. Then\n      insert the paper and turn on the printer.\n24.8.8\nDebugging CUPS\n#\nUse the following generic procedure to locate problems in CUPS:\nSet\nLogLevel debug\nin\n/etc/cups/cupsd.conf\n.\nStop\ncupsd\n.\nRemove\n/var/log/cups/error_log*\nto avoid having to\n      search through very large log files.\nStart\ncupsd\n.\nRepeat the action that led to the problem.\nCheck the messages in\n/var/log/cups/error_log*\nto\n      identify the cause of the problem.\n24.8.9\nMore information\n#\nIn-depth information about printing on\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nis presented in the\n    openSUSE Support Database at\nhttps://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Printing\n.\nSolutions to many specific problems are presented in the\n    SUSE Knowledgebase (\nhttps://www.suse.com/support/\n).

This chapter describes the\n    configuration of the graphical user interface for all users.\n25.1\nX Window System\n#\nThe X.org server is the de facto standard for implementing the X11\n   protocol. X is network-based, enabling applications started on one\n   host to be displayed on another host connected over any kind of\n   network (LAN or Internet).\nUsually, the X Window System needs no configuration. The hardware is\n   dynamically detected during X start-up. The use of\nxorg.conf\nis therefore deprecated. If you still\n   need to specify custom options to change the way X behaves, you can\n   still do so by modifying configuration files under\n/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/\n.\nTip: IBM Z: configuring the graphical user interface\nIBM Z does not have any input or output devices supported by\n    X.Org. Therefore, none of the configuration procedures described in this\n    section apply. More relevant information for IBM Z can be found in\nChapter 5,\nInstallation on IBM Z and LinuxONE\n.\nInstall the package\nxorg-docs\nto\n   get more in-depth information about X11.\nman 5 xorg.conf\ntells you more about the format of the manual configuration (if needed).\n   More information on the X11 development can be found on the project's home\n   page at\nhttp://www.x.org\n.\nDrivers are found in\nxf86-video-*\npackages, for\n   example\nxf86-video-ati\n. Many of the drivers\n   delivered with these packages are described in detail in the related manual\n   page. For example, if you use the\nati\ndriver, find more\n   information about this driver in\nman 4 ati\n.\nInformation about third-party drivers is available in\n/usr/share/doc/packages/<package_name>\n.\n   For example, the documentation of\nx11-video-nvidiaG03\nis available in\n/usr/share/doc/packages/x11-video-nvidiaG04\nafter the package was installed.\nInstall the package\nxrdp\non a server and use RDP client software\n   to access the server via the remote desktop protocol.\n25.2\nInstalling and configuring fonts\n#\nFonts in Linux can be categorized into two parts:\nOutline or vector fonts\nContains a mathematical description as drawing instructions about the\n     shape of a glyph. As such, each glyph can be scaled to arbitrary sizes\n     without loss of quality. Before such a font (or glyph) can be used, the\n     mathematical descriptions need to be transformed into a raster (grid).\n     This process is called\nfont rasterization\n.\nFont hinting\n(embedded inside the font) improves and\n     optimizes the rendering result for a particular size. Rasterization and\n     hinting is done with the FreeType library.\nCommon formats under Linux are PostScript Type 1 and Type 2, TrueType, and\n     OpenType.\nBitmap or raster fonts\nConsists of an array of pixels designed for a specific font size. Bitmap\n     fonts are extremely fast and simple to render. However, compared to vector\n     fonts, bitmap fonts cannot be scaled without losing quality. As such,\n     these fonts are usually distributed in different sizes. These days, bitmap\n     fonts are still used in the Linux console and sometimes in terminals.\nUnder Linux, Portable Compiled Format (PCF) or Glyph Bitmap Distribution\n     Format (BDF) are the most common formats.\nThe appearance of these fonts can be influenced by two main aspects:\nchoosing a suitable font family,\nrendering the font with an algorithm that achieves results comfortable for\n    the receiver's eyes.\nThe last point is only relevant to vector fonts. Although the above two\n  points are highly subjective, some defaults need to be created.\nLinux font rendering systems consist of several libraries with different\n  relations. The basic font rendering library is\nFreeType\n, which converts\n  font glyphs of supported formats into optimized bitmap glyphs. The rendering\n  process is controlled by an algorithm and its parameters (which may be\n  subject to patent issues).\nEvery program or library which uses FreeType should consult the\nFontconfig\nlibrary. This\n  library gathers font configuration from users and from the system. When a\n  user amends their Fontconfig setting, this change will result in\n  Fontconfig-aware applications.\nMore sophisticated OpenType shaping needed for scripts such as Arabic, Han or\n  Phags-Pa and other higher level text processing is done using\nHarfbuzz\nor\nPango\n.\n25.2.1\nShowing installed fonts\n#\nTo get an overview about which fonts are installed on your system, ask the\n   commands\nrpm\nor\nfc-list\n. Both will\n   give you a good answer, but may return a different list depending on system\n   and user configuration:\nrpm\nInvoke\nrpm\nto see which software packages containing\n      fonts are installed on your system:\n>\nrpm -qa '*fonts*'\nEvery font package should satisfy this expression. However, the command\n      may return some false positives like\nfonts-config\n(which is neither a font nor does it contain fonts).\nfc-list\nInvoke\nfc-list\nto get an overview about what font\n      families can be accessed, whether they are installed on the system or in\n      your home:\n>\nfc-list ':' family\nNote: Command\nfc-list\nThe command\nfc-list\nis a wrapper to the Fontconfig\n       library. It is possible to query a lot of interesting information from\n       Fontconfig—or, to be more precise, from its cache. See\nman 1 fc-list\nfor more details.\n25.2.2\nViewing fonts\n#\nIf you want to know what an installed font family looks like, either use the\n   command\nftview\n(package\nft2demos\n) or visit\nhttp://fontinfo.opensuse.org/\n. For example, to display\n   the FreeMono font in 14 point, use\nftview\nlike this:\n>\nftview 14 /usr/share/fonts/truetype/FreeMono.ttf\nIf you need further information, go to\nhttp://fontinfo.opensuse.org/\nto find out which styles\n   (regular, bold, italic, etc.) and languages are supported.\n25.2.3\nQuerying fonts\n#\nTo query which font is used when a pattern is given, use the\nfc-match\ncommand.\nFor example, if your pattern contains an already installed font,\nfc-match\nreturns the file name, font family, and the\n   style:\n>\nfc-match 'Liberation Serif'\nLiberationSerif-Regular.ttf: \"Liberation Serif\" \"Regular\"\nIf the desired font does not exist on your system, Fontconfig's matching\n   rules take place and try to find the most similar fonts available. This\n   means, your request is substituted:\n>\nfc-match 'Foo Family'\nDejaVuSans.ttf: \"DejaVu Sans\" \"Book\"\nFontconfig supports\naliases\n: a name is substituted with\n   another family name. A typical example are the generic names such as\n“\nsans-serif\n”\n,\n“\nserif\n”\n, and\n“\nmonospace\n”\n. These alias names can be substituted by real\n   family names or even a preference list of family names:\n>\nfor font in serif sans mono; do fc-match \"$font\" ; done\nDejaVuSerif.ttf: \"DejaVu Serif\" \"Book\"\nDejaVuSans.ttf: \"DejaVu Sans\" \"Book\"\nDejaVuSansMono.ttf: \"DejaVu Sans Mono\" \"Book\"\nThe result may vary on your system, depending on which fonts are currently\n   installed.\nNote: Similarity rules according to fontconfig\nFontconfig\nalways\nreturns a real family (if at least\n    one is installed) according to the given request, as similar as possible.\n“\nSimilarity\n”\ndepends on Fontconfig's internal metrics and on\n    the user's or administrator's Fontconfig settings.\n25.2.4\nInstalling fonts\n#\nTo install a new font there are these major methods:\nManually install the font files such as\n*.ttf\nor\n*.otf\nto a known font directory. If it needs to be\n     system-wide, use the standard directory\n/usr/share/fonts\n. For installation in your home\n     directory, use\n~/.config/fonts\n.\nIf you want to deviate from the standard directories, Fontconfig allows\n     you to choose another one. Let Fontconfig know by using the\n<dir>\nelement, see\nSection 25.2.5.2, “Diving into fontconfig XML”\nfor details.\nInstall fonts using\nzypper\n. Lots of fonts are already\n     available as a package, be it on your SUSE distribution or in the\nM17N:fonts\nrepository. Add the repository to your list using the following command.\n     For example, to add a repository for\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n15 SP4\n:\n>\nsudo\nzypper ar\nhttps://download.opensuse.org/repositories/M17N:/fonts/SLE_15/\nTo search for your\nFONT_FAMILY_NAME\nuse this\n     command:\n>\nzypper se '\nFONT_FAMILY_NAME\n*fonts'\n25.2.5\nConfiguring the appearance of fonts\n#\nDepending on the rendering medium, and font size, the result may be\n   unsatisfactory. For example, an average monitor these days has a resolution\n   of 100dpi which makes pixels too big and glyphs look clunky.\nThere are several algorithms available to deal with low resolutions, such as\n   anti-aliasing (grayscale smoothing), hinting (fitting to the grid), or\n   subpixel rendering (tripling resolution in one direction). These algorithms\n   can also differ from one font format to another.\nVia Fontconfig, it is possible to select a rendering algorithms for every\n   font individually or for a set of fonts.\n25.2.5.1\nConfiguring fonts via\nsysconfig\n#\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\ncomes with a\nsysconfig\nlayer above\n    Fontconfig. This is a good starting point for experimenting with font\n    configuration. To change the default settings, edit the configuration file\n/etc/sysconfig/fonts-config\n. (or use the YaST\n    sysconfig module). After you have edited the file, run\nfonts-config\n:\n>\nsudo\n/usr/sbin/fonts-config\nRestart the application to make the effect visible. Keep in mind the\n    following issues:\nA few applications do need not to be restarted. For example, Firefox\n      re-reads Fontconfig configuration from time to time. Newly created or\n      reloaded tabs get new font configurations later.\nThe\nfonts-config\nscript is called automatically after\n      every package installation or removal (if not, it is a bug of the font\n      software package).\nEvery sysconfig variable can be temporarily overridden by the\nfonts-config\ncommand line option. See\nfonts-config --help\nfor details.\nThere are several sysconfig variables which can be altered. See\nman 1 fonts-config\nor the help page of the YaST\n    sysconfig module. The following variables are examples:\nUsage of rendering algorithms\nConsider\nFORCE_HINTSTYLE\n,\nFORCE_AUTOHINT\n,\nFORCE_BW\n,\nFORCE_BW_MONOSPACE\n,\nUSE_EMBEDDED_BITMAPS\nand\nEMBEDDED_BITMAP_LANGAGES\nPreference lists of generic aliases\nUse\nPREFER_SANS_FAMILIES\n,\nPREFER_SERIF_FAMILIES\n,\nPREFER_MONO_FAMILIES\nand\nSEARCH_METRIC_COMPATIBLE\nThe following list provides some configuration examples, sorted from the\n“\nmost readable\n”\nfonts (more contrast) to\n“\nmost\n    beautiful\n”\n(more smoothed).\nBitmap fonts\nPrefer bitmap fonts via the\nPREFER_*_FAMILIES\nvariables. Follow the example in the help section for these variables.\n       Be aware that these fonts are rendered black and white, not smoothed and\n       that bitmap fonts are available in several sizes only. Consider using\nSEARCH_METRIC_COMPATIBLE=\"no\"\nto disable metric compatibility-driven family name substitutions.\nScalable fonts rendered black and white\nScalable fonts rendered without antialiasing can result in a similar\n       outcome to bitmap fonts, while maintaining font scalability. Use well\n       hinted fonts like the Liberation families. Unfortunately, there is a\n       lack of well hinted fonts though. Set the following variable to force\n       this method:\nFORCE_BW=\"yes\"\nMonospaced fonts rendered black and white\nRender monospaced fonts without antialiasing only, otherwise use default\n       settings:\nFORCE_BW_MONOSPACE=\"yes\"\nDefault settings\nAll fonts are rendered with antialiasing. Well hinted fonts will be\n       rendered with the\nbyte code interpreter\n(BCI) and\n       the rest with autohinter (\nhintstyle=hintslight\n).\n       Leave all relevant sysconfig variables to the default setting.\nCFF fonts\nUse fonts in CFF format. They can be considered also more readable than\n       the default TrueType fonts given the current improvements in FreeType2.\n       Try them out by following the example of\nPREFER_*_FAMILIES\n. Possibly make them more dark and\n       bold with:\nSEARCH_METRIC_COMPATIBLE=\"no\"\nas they are rendered by\nhintstyle=hintslight\nby\n       default. Also consider using:\nSEARCH_METRIC_COMPATIBLE=\"no\"\nAutohinter exclusively\nEven for a well hinted font, use FreeType2's autohinter. That can lead\n       to thicker, sometimes fuzzier letter shapes with lower contrast. Set the\n       following variable to activate this:\nFORCE_AUTOHINTER=\"yes\"\nUse\nFORCE_HINTSTYLE\nto control the level of hinting.\n25.2.5.2\nDiving into fontconfig XML\n#\nFontconfig's configuration format is the\neXtensible Markup\n    Language\n(XML). These few examples are not a complete reference,\n    but a brief overview. Details and other inspiration can be found in\nman 5 fonts-conf\nor in\n/etc/fonts/conf.d/\n.\nThe central Fontconfig configuration file is\n/etc/fonts/fonts.conf\n, which—along other\n    work—includes the whole\n/etc/fonts/conf.d/\ndirectory. To customize Fontconfig, there are two places where you can\n    insert your changes:\nFontconfig configuration files\n#\nSystem-wide changes.\nEdit the file\n/etc/fonts/local.conf\n(by default, it\n       contains an empty\nfontconfig\nelement).\nUser-specific changes.\nEdit the file\n~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf\n.\n       Place Fontconfig configuration files in the\n~/.config/fontconfig/conf.d/\ndirectory.\nUser-specific changes overwrite any system-wide settings.\nNote: Deprecated user configuration file\nThe file\n~/.fonts.conf\nis marked as deprecated and\n     should not be used anymore. Use\n~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf\ninstead.\nEvery configuration file needs to have a\nfontconfig\nelement. As such, the minimal file looks like this:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n   <!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM \"fonts.dtd\">\n   <fontconfig>\n   <!-- Insert your changes here -->\n   </fontconfig>\nIf the default directories are not enough, insert the\ndir\nelement with the respective directory:\n<dir>/usr/share/fonts2</dir>\nFontconfig searches\nrecursively\nfor fonts.\nFont-rendering algorithms can be chosen with following Fontconfig snippet\n    (see\nExample 25.1, “Specifying rendering algorithms”\n):\nExample 25.1:\nSpecifying rendering algorithms\n#\n<match target=\"font\">\n <test name=\"family\">\n  <string>\nFAMILY_NAME\n</string>\n </test>\n <edit name=\"antialias\" mode=\"assign\">\n  <bool>true</bool>\n </edit>\n <edit name=\"hinting\" mode=\"assign\">\n  <bool>true</bool>\n </edit>\n <edit name=\"autohint\" mode=\"assign\">\n  <bool>false</bool>\n </edit>\n <edit name=\"hintstyle\" mode=\"assign\">\n  <const>hintfull</const>\n </edit>\n</match>\nVarious properties of fonts can be tested. For example, the\n<test>\nelement can test for the font family (as\n    shown in the example), size interval, spacing, font format, and others.\n    When abandoning\n<test>\ncompletely, all\n<edit>\nelements will be applied to every font\n    (global change).\nExample 25.2:\nAliases and family name substitutions\n#\nRule 1\n<alias>\n <family>Alegreya SC</family>\n <default>\n  <family>serif</family>\n </default>\n</alias>\nRule 2\n<alias>\n <family>serif</family>\n <prefer>\n  <family>Droid Serif</family>\n </prefer>\n</alias>\nRule 3\n<alias>\n <family>serif</family>\n <accept>\n  <family>STIXGeneral</family>\n </accept>\n</alias>\nThe rules from\nExample 25.2, “Aliases and family name substitutions”\ncreate\n    a\nprioritized family list\n(PFL). Depending on the\n    element, different actions are performed:\n<default>\nfrom\nRule 1\nThis rule adds a\nserif\nfamily name\nat the\n       end\nof the PFL.\n<prefer>\nfrom\nRule 2\nThis rule adds\n“\nDroid Serif\n”\njust\n       before\nthe first occurrence of\nserif\nin\n       the PFL, whenever\nAlegreya SC\nis in PFL.\n<accept>\nfrom\nRule 3\nThis rule adds a\n“\nSTIXGeneral\n”\nfamily name\njust\n       after\nthe first occurrence of the\nserif\nfamily name in the PFL.\nPutting this together, when snippets occur in the order\nRule 1\n-\nRule 2\n-\nRule 3\nand the user\n    requests\n“\nAlegreya SC\n”\n, then the PFL is created as depicted in\nTable 25.1, “Generating PFL from fontconfig rules”\n.\nTable 25.1:\nGenerating PFL from fontconfig rules\n#\nOrder\nCurrent PFL\nRequest\nAlegreya SC\nRule 1\nAlegreya SC\n,\nserif\nRule 2\nAlegreya SC\n,\nDroid Serif\n,\nserif\nRule 3\nAlegreya SC\n,\nDroid Serif\n,\nserif\n,\nSTIXGeneral\nIn Fontconfig's metrics, the family name has the highest priority over\n    other patterns, like style, size, etc. Fontconfig checks which family is\n    currently installed on the system. If\n“\nAlegreya SC\n”\nis\n    installed, then Fontconfig returns it. If not, it asks for\n“\nDroid\n    Serif\n”\n, etc.\nBe careful. When the order of Fontconfig snippets is changed, Fontconfig\n    can return different results, as depicted in\nTable 25.2, “Results from generating PFL from fontconfig rules with changed order”\n.\nTable 25.2:\nResults from generating PFL from fontconfig rules with changed order\n#\nOrder\nCurrent PFL\nNote\nRequest\nAlegreya SC\nSame request performed.\nRule 2\nAlegreya SC\nserif\nnot in PFL, nothing is substituted\nRule 3\nAlegreya SC\nserif\nnot in PFL, nothing is substituted\nRule 1\nAlegreya SC\n,\nserif\nAlegreya SC\npresent in PFL, substitution is\n         performed\nNote: Implication\nThink of the\n<default>\nalias as a classification\n     or inclusion of this group (if not installed). As the example shows,\n<default>\nshould always precede the\n<prefer>\nand\n<accept>\naliases of that group.\n<default>\nclassification is not limited to the\n     generic aliases serif, sans-serif and monospace. See\n/usr/share/fontconfig/conf.avail/30-metric-aliases.conf\nfor a complex example.\nThe following Fontconfig snippet in\nExample 25.3, “Aliases and family name substitutions”\ncreates a\nserif\ngroup. Every family in this group could substitute\n    others when a former font is not installed.\nExample 25.3:\nAliases and family name substitutions\n#\n<alias>\n <family>Alegreya SC</family>\n <default>\n  <family>serif</family>\n </default>\n</alias>\n<alias>\n <family>Droid Serif</family>\n <default>\n  <family>serif</family>\n </default>\n</alias>\n<alias>\n <family>STIXGeneral</family>\n <default>\n  <family>serif</family>\n </default>\n</alias>\n<alias>\n <family>serif</family>\n <accept>\n  <family>Droid Serif</family>\n  <family>STIXGeneral</family>\n  <family>Alegreya SC</family>\n </accept>\n</alias>\nPriority is given by the order in the\n<accept>\nalias. Similarly, stronger\n<prefer>\naliases can be\n    used.\nExample 25.2, “Aliases and family name substitutions”\nis expanded by\nExample 25.4, “Aliases and family names substitutions”\n.\nExample 25.4:\nAliases and family names substitutions\n#\nRule 4\n<alias>\n <family>serif</family>\n <accept>\n  <family>Liberation Serif</family>\n </accept>\n</alias>\nRule 5\n<alias>\n <family>serif</family>\n <prefer>\n  <family>DejaVu Serif</family>\n </prefer>\n</alias>\nThe expanded configuration from\nExample 25.4, “Aliases and family names substitutions”\nwould lead to the\n    following PFL evolution:\nTable 25.3:\nResults from generating PFL from fontconfig rules\n#\nOrder\nCurrent PFL\nRequest\nAlegreya SC\nRule 1\nAlegreya SC\n,\nserif\nRule 2\nAlegreya SC\n,\nDroid Serif\n,\nserif\nRule 3\nAlegreya SC\n,\nDroid Serif\n,\nserif\n,\nSTIXGeneral\nRule 4\nAlegreya SC\n,\nDroid Serif\n,\nserif\n,\nLiberation Serif\n,\nSTIXGeneral\nRule 5\nAlegreya SC\n,\nDroid Serif\n,\nDejaVu Serif\n,\nserif\n,\nLiberation Serif\n,\nSTIXGeneral\nNote: Implications.\nIn case multiple\n<accept>\ndeclarations for the\n       same generic name exist, the declaration that is parsed last\n“\nwins\n”\n. If possible, do not use\n<accept>\nafter\nuser (\n/etc/fonts/conf.d/*-user.conf\n) when creating\n       a system-wide configuration.\nIn case multiple\n<prefer\ndeclarations for the same\n       generic name exist, the declaration that is parsed last\n“\nwins\n”\n. If possible, do not use\n<prefer>\nbefore\nuser in the system-wide\n       configuration.\nEvery\n<prefer>\ndeclaration overwrites\n<accept>\ndeclarations for the same generic\n       name. If the administrator wants to allow the user to use\n<accept>\nand not only\n<prefer>\n, the administrator should not use\n<prefer>\nin the system-wide configuration. On\n       the other hand, as users mostly use\n<prefer>\n,\n       this should not have any detrimental effect. We also see the use of\n<prefer>\nin system-wide configurations.\n25.3\nGNOME configuration for administrators\n#\n25.3.1\nThe\ndconf\nsystem\n#\nConfiguration of the GNOME desktop is managed with\ndconf\n. It is a hierarchically structured database or\n    registry that allows users to modify their personal settings, and system\n    administrators to set default or mandatory values for all users.\ndconf\nreplaces the\ngconf\nsystem of\n    GNOME 2.\nUse\ndconf-editor\nto view the\ndconf\noptions with a graphical user interface. Use\ndconf\nto\n    access and modify configuration options with the command line.\nThe GNOME\nTweaks\ntool provides an easy-to-use\n    user interface for additional configuration options beyond the\n    normal GNOME configuration. The tool can be started from the\n    GNOME application menu or from the command line with\ngnome-tweak-tool\n.\n25.3.2\nSystem-wide configuration\n#\nGlobal\ndconf\nconfiguration parameters can be set\n    in the\n/etc/dconf/db/\ndirectory. This includes\n    the configuration for GDM or locking certain configuration options\n    for users.\nUse the following procedure as an example to create a system-wide\n    configuration:\nCreate a new directory that ends with a\n.d\nin\n/etc/dconf/db/\n. This directory can contain an\n      arbitrary amount of text files with configuration options. For this\n      example, create the file\n/etc/dconf/db/network.d/00-proxy\nwith the\n      following content:\n# This is a comment\n[system/proxy/http]\nhost='10.0.0.1'\nenabled=true\nParse the new configuration directives into the dconf database format:\n>\nsudo\ndconf update\nAdd the new\nnetwork\nconfiguration database to\n      the default user profile, by creating the file\n/etc/dconf/profile/user\n.\n      Then add the following content:\nsystem-db:network\nThe file\n/etc/dconf/profile/user\nis a GNOME\n      default. Other profiles can be defined in the environment variable\nDCONF_PROFILE\n.\nOptional: To lock the proxy configuration for users, create the file\n/etc/dconf/db/network/locks/proxy\n. Then add\n      a line to this file with the keys that may not be changed:\n/system/proxy/http/host\n/system/proxy/http/enabled\nYou can use the graphical\ndconf-editor\nto create a\n    profile with one user and then use\ndconf dump /\nto list all configuration options. The configuration options can\n    then be stored in a global profile.\nA detailed description of the global configuration is available at\nhttps://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/dconf/SystemAdministrators\n.\n25.3.3\nMore information\n#\nFor more information, see\nhttp://help.gnome.org/admin/\n.\n25.4\nSwitching between Intel and NVIDIA Optimus GPUs with SUSE Prime\n#\nSUSE Prime is a tool for switching between onboard Intel graphical\n   processing units (GPUs), and NVIDIA GPUs equipped with NVIDIA's \"switchable\n   graphics\" Optimus technology. Optimus provides a mechanism for easily\n   switching between an onboard Intel GPU and a discrete NVIDIA GPU. This is\n   designed for running a laptop in a power-saving mode or at maximum\n   performance: use the Intel GPU to save power, and the NVIDIA GPU for 3D\n   applications.\nSUSE Prime works only on systems running X11, not Wayland. If your system\n   runs Wayland, you must disable it and fall back to X11 if you want to use\n   SUSE Prime (see\nSection 25.4.1, “Prerequisites”\n).\n25.4.1\nPrerequisites\n#\nThere must not be a\n/etc/X11/xorg.conf\nfile, and no\n    configuration files with active \"ServerLayout\", \"Device\", or \"Screen\"\n    sections in the\n/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d\ndirectory.\nSUSE Prime works only with X11. Use the\nloginctl\ncommand to see if your system is using X11 or Wayland:\n>\nloginctl\n   SESSION        UID USER             SEAT             TTY             \n         2       1000 tux             seat0\n>\nloginctl show-session 2|grep Type\nType=x11\nIf your system uses Wayland, disable it by editing\n/etc/gdm/custom.conf\nand un-commenting\nWaylandEnable=false\n.

Normally, you need to be\nroot\nfor this task. FUSE alone is\n    a kernel module. Combined with plug-ins, it allows you to extend FUSE to\n    access almost all file systems like remote SSH connections, ISO images, and\n    more.\n26.1\nConfiguring FUSE\n#\nBefore you can use FUSE, you need to install the package\nfuse\n. Depending which file system\n   you want to use, you need additional plug-ins available as separate\n   packages.\nGenerally you do not need to configure FUSE. However, it is a good idea to\n   create a directory where all your mount points are combined. For example,\n   you can create a directory\n~/mounts\nand insert your\n   subdirectories for your different file systems there.\n26.2\nMounting an NTFS partition\n#\nNTFS, the\nNew Technology File System\n, is the default\n   file system of Windows. Since under normal circumstances the unprivileged\n   user cannot mount NTFS block devices using the external FUSE library, the\n   process of mounting a Windows partition described below requires root\n   privileges.\nMounting NTFS partitions is supported on\n   SUSE Linux Enterprise Server and SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop with SUSE Linux Enterprise Workstation Extension only.\nBecome\nroot\nand install the\n     package\nntfs-3g\n.\nIt is available in SUSE Linux Enterprise Workstation Extension.\nCreate a directory that is to be used as a mount point, for example\n~/mounts/windows\n.\nFind out which Windows partition you need. Use YaST and start the\n     partitioner module to see which partition belongs to Windows, but do not\n     modify anything. Alternatively, become\nroot\nand execute\n/sbin/fdisk\n-l\n. Look for partitions\n     with a partition type of\nHPFS/NTFS\n.\nMount the partition in read-write mode. Replace the placeholder\nDEVICE\nwith your respective Windows partition:\n>\nntfs-3g /dev/\nDEVICE\nMOUNT POINT\nTo use your Windows partition in read-only mode, append\n-o\n     ro\n:\n>\nntfs-3g /dev/\nDEVICE\nMOUNT POINT\n-o ro\nThe command\nntfs-3g\nuses the current user (UID) and\n     group (GID) to mount the given device. If you want to set the write\n     permissions to a different user, use the command\nid\nUSER\nto get the output of the UID and GID values. Set it\n     with:\n#\nid tux\nuid=1000(tux) gid=100(users) groups=100(users),16(dialout),33(video)\nntfs-3g /dev/\nDEVICE\nMOUNT POINT\n-o uid=1000,gid=100\nFind additional options in the man page.\nTo unmount the resource, run\nfusermount -u\nMOUNT POINT\n.\n26.3\nMore information\n#\nFor more information, see the home page of FUSE at\nhttps://github.com/libfuse/libfuse\n.\nOn this page\n26.1\nConfiguring FUSE\n26.2\nMounting an NTFS partition\n26.3\nMore information\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

When installing a second kernel, a boot entry and an initrd are\n    automatically created, so no further manual configuration is needed. When\n    rebooting the machine, the newly added kernel is available as an additional\n    boot parameter.\nUsing this functionality, you can safely test kernel updates while being\n    able to always fall back to the proven former kernel. To do this, do not use\n    the update tools (such as the YaST Online Update or the updater applet),\n    but instead follow the process described in this chapter.\nWarning: Support entitlement\nBe aware that you lose your entire support entitlement for the machine when\n   installing a self-compiled or a third-party kernel. Only kernels shipped\n   with\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nand kernels delivered via the official update channels\n   for\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nare supported.\nTip: Check your boot loader configuration kernel\nIt is recommended to check your boot loader configuration after having\n   installed another kernel to set the default boot entry of your choice. See\nSection 18.3, “Configuring the boot loader with YaST”\nfor more information.\n27.1\nEnabling and configuring multiversion support\n#\nInstalling multiple versions of a software package (multiversion support) is\n   enabled by default from\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12\n. To verify this setting, proceed as\n   follows:\nOpen\n/etc/zypp/zypp.conf\nwith the editor of your\n     choice as\nroot\n.\nSearch for the string\nmultiversion\n. If multiversion is\n     enabled for all kernel packages capable of this feature, the following\n     line appears uncommented:\nmultiversion = provides:multiversion(kernel)\nTo restrict multiversion support to certain kernel flavors, add the\n     package names as a comma-separated list to the\nmultiversion\noption in\n/etc/zypp/zypp.conf\n—for example\nmultiversion = kernel-default,kernel-default-base,kernel-source\nSave your changes.\nWarning: Kernel Module Packages (KMP)\nMake sure that required vendor-provided kernel modules (Kernel Module\n    Packages) are also installed for the new updated kernel. The kernel update\n    process will not warn about eventually missing kernel modules because\n    package requirements are still fulfilled by the old kernel that is kept on\n    the system.\n27.1.1\nAutomatically deleting unused kernels\n#\nWhen frequently testing new kernels with multiversion support enabled, the\n    boot menu quickly becomes confusing. Since a\n/boot\npartition usually has limited space you also might run into trouble with\n/boot\noverflowing. While you can delete unused kernel\n    versions manually with YaST or Zypper (as described below), you can also\n    configure\nlibzypp\nto automatically\n    delete kernels no longer used. By default no kernels are deleted.\nOpen\n/etc/zypp/zypp.conf\nwith the editor of your\n      choice as\nroot\n.\nSearch for the string\nmultiversion.kernels\nand\n      activate this option by uncommenting the line. This option takes a\n      comma-separated list of the following values:\n5.3.18-53.3\n:\nkeep the kernel with the specified version number\nlatest\n:\nkeep the kernel with the highest version number\nlatest-N\n:\nkeep the kernel with the Nth highest version number\nrunning\n:\nkeep the running kernel\noldest\n:\nkeep the kernel with the lowest version number (the one that was\n       originally shipped with\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n)\noldest+N\n.\nkeep the kernel with the Nth lowest version number\nHere are some examples\nmultiversion.kernels = latest,running\nKeep the latest kernel and the one currently running. This is similar\n         to not enabling the multiversion feature, except that the old kernel\n         is removed\nafter the next reboot\nand not\n         immediately after the installation.\nmultiversion.kernels = latest,latest-1,running\nKeep the last two kernels and the one currently running.\nmultiversion.kernels = latest,running,\n5.3.18-53.3\nKeep the latest kernel, the one currently running, and\n5.3.18-53.3\n.\nTip: Keep the running kernel\nUnless you are using a special setup, always keep the\n       kernel marked\nrunning\n.\nIf you do not keep the running kernel, it will be deleted when\n       updating the kernel. In turn, this means that all of the running\n       kernel's modules are also deleted and cannot be loaded anymore.\nIf you decide not to keep the running kernel, always reboot\n       immediately after a kernel upgrade to avoid issues with modules.\n27.1.2\nUse case: Deleting an old kernel after reboot only\n#\nYou want to make sure that an old kernel will only be deleted after the\n    system has rebooted successfully with the new kernel.\nChange the following line in\n/etc/zypp/zypp.conf\n:\nmultiversion.kernels = latest,running\nThe previous parameters tell the system to keep the latest kernel and the\n    running one only if they differ.\n27.1.3\nUse case: Keeping older kernels as fallback\n#\nYou want to keep one or more kernel versions to have one or more\n“\nspare\n”\nkernels.\nThis can be useful if you need kernels for testing. If something goes wrong\n    (for example, your machine does not boot), you\n    still can use one or more kernel versions which are known to be good.\nChange the following line in\n/etc/zypp/zypp.conf\n:\nmultiversion.kernels = latest,latest-1,latest-2,running\nWhen you reboot your system after the installation of a new kernel, the\n    system will keep three kernels: the current kernel (configured as\nlatest,running\n) and its two immediate predecessors\n    (configured as\nlatest-1\nand\nlatest-2\n).\n27.1.4\nUse case: Keeping a specific kernel version\n#\nYou make regular system updates and install new kernel versions. However,\n    you are also compiling your own kernel version and want\n    to make sure that the system will keep them.\nChange the following line in\n/etc/zypp/zypp.conf\n:\nmultiversion.kernels = latest,5.3.18-53.3,running\nWhen you reboot your system after the installation of a new kernel, the\n    system will keep two kernels: the new and running kernel (configured as\nlatest,running\n) and your self-compiled kernel\n    (configured as\n5.3.18-53.3\n).\n27.2\nInstalling/removing multiple kernel versions with YaST\n#\nYou can install or remove multiple kernels with YaST:\nStart YaST and open the software manager via\nSoftware\n›\nSoftware Management\n.\nList all packages capable of providing multiple versions by choosing\nView\n›\nPackage Classification\n›\nMultiversion Packages\n.\nFigure 27.1:\nThe YaST software manager: multiversion view\n#\nSelect a package and open its\nVersion\ntab in the bottom\n     pane on the left.\nTo install a package, click the check box next to it. A green check mark indicates it\n     is selected for installation.\nTo remove an already installed package (marked with a white check mark),\n     click the check box next to it until a red\nX\nindicates it is\n     selected for removal.\nClick\nAccept\nto start the installation.\n27.3\nInstalling/removing multiple kernel versions with Zypper\n#\nYou can install or remove multiple kernels with\nzypper\n:\nUse the command\nzypper se -s 'kernel*'\nto display a\n     list of all kernel packages available:\nS  | Name                 | Type    | Version           | Arch   |

These are special objects that can be inserted into the kernel and\n   removed on demand. In practical terms, kernel modules make it possible to\n   add and remove drivers and interfaces that are not included in the kernel\n   itself. Linux provides several commands for managing kernel modules.\n28.1\nListing loaded modules with lsmod and modinfo\n#\nUse the\nlsmod\ncommand to view what kernel modules are\n    currently loaded. The output of the command may look as follows:\n>\nlsmod\nModule                  Size  Used by\nsnd_usb_audio         188416  2\nsnd_usbmidi_lib        36864  1 snd_usb_audio\nhid_plantronics        16384  0\nsnd_rawmidi            36864  1 snd_usbmidi_lib\nsnd_seq_device         16384  1 snd_rawmidi\nfuse                  106496  3\nnfsv3                  45056  1\nnfs_acl                16384  1 nfsv3\nThe output is divided into three columns. The\nModule\ncolumn lists the names\n    of the loaded modules, while the\nSize\ncolumn displays the size of each\n    module. The\nUsed by\ncolumn shows the number of referring\n    modules and their names. Note that this list may be incomplete.\nTo view detailed information about a specific kernel module, use the\nmodinfo\nMODULE_NAME\ncommand, where\nMODULE_NAME\nis the name of the desired kernel\n    module. Note that the\nmodinfo\nbinary resides in the\n/sbin\ndirectory that is not in the user's PATH\n    environment variable. This means that you must specify the full path to the\n    binary when running\nmodinfo\ncommand as a regular user:\n>\n/sbin/modinfo kvm\nfilename:       /lib/modules/5.3.18-57-default/kernel/arch/x86/kvm/kvm.ko.xz\nlicense:        GPL\nauthor:         Qumranet\nsuserelease:    SLE15-SP3\nsrcversion:     3D8FBA9060D4537359A06FC\ndepends:        irqbypass\nsupported:      yes\nretpoline:      Y\nintree:         Y\nname:           kvm\nvermagic:       5.3.18-57-default SMP mod_unload modversions\n28.2\nAdding and removing kernel modules\n#\nWhile it is possible to use\ninsmod\nand\nrmmod\nto add and remove kernel modules, it is recommended to use the\nmodprobe\ntool instead.\nmodprobe\noffers several\n      important advantages, including automatic dependency resolution and\n      blacklisting.\nWhen used without any parameters, the\nmodprobe\ncommand installs a specified kernel module.\nmodprobe\nmust be run with root privileges:\n>\nsudo\nmodprobe acpi\nTo remove a kernel module, use the\n-r\nparameter:\n>\nsudo\nmodprobe -r acpi\n28.2.1\nLoading kernel modules automatically on boot\n#\nInstead of loading kernel modules manually, you can load them\n      automatically during the boot process using the\nsystem-modules-load.service\nservice. To enable a\n    kernel module, add a\n.conf\nfile to the\n/etc/modules-load.d/\ndirectory. It is good practice\n    to give the configuration file the same name as the module, for example:\n/etc/modules-load.d/rt2800usb.conf\nThe configuration file must contain the name of the desired kernel\n      module (for example,\nrt2800usb\n).\nThe described technique allows you to load kernel modules without any\n      parameters. If you need to load a kernel module with specific options,\n      add a configuration file to the\n/etc/modprobe.d/\ndirectory instead. The file must have the\n.conf\nextension. The name of the file should adhere to the following naming convention:\npriority-modulename.conf\n, for example:\n50-thinkfan.conf\n. The configuration file must\n      contain the name of the kernel module and the desired parameters. You can use the\n    example command below to create a configuration file containing the name of the kernel module and its parameters:\n>\necho \"options thinkpad_acpi fan_control=1\" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/thinkfan.conf\nNote: Loading kernel modules\nMost kernel modules are loaded by the system automatically when a\n          device is detected or user space requests specific\n          functionality. Thus, adding modules manually to\n/etc/modules-load.d/\nis rarely required.\n28.2.2\nBlacklisting kernel modules with modprobe\n#\nBlacklisting a kernel module prevents it from loading during the boot\n      process. This can be useful when you want to disable a module that you\n      suspect is causing problems on your system. Note that you can still load\n      blacklisted kernel modules manually using the\ninsmod\nor\nmodprobe\ntools.\nTo blacklist a module, create a file\n/etc/modprobe.d/60-blacklist-\nMODULE_NAME\n.conf\nwith the following content:\nblacklist\nMODULE_NAME\nRun the\ndracut\ncommand as root to generate a new\ninitrd\nimage, then reboot your machine (replace\nNAME\nwith the name of the current initrd and\nKERNELVERSION\nwith the currently running kernel):\n>\nsu\necho \"blacklist nouveau\" >> /etc/modprobe.d/60-blacklist-nouveau.conf\n/usr/bin/dracut --logfile /var/log/YaST2/mkinitrd.log --force /boot/$initrd-\nNAME\n$\nKERNELVERSION\nreboot\nTo disable a kernel module temporarily only,\n      blacklist it on-the-fly during the boot. To do this, press the\nE\nkey when you see the boot screen. This drops you into\n      a minimal editor that allows you to modify boot parameters. Locate the\n      line that looks as follows:\nlinux /boot/vmlinuz...splash= silent quiet showopts\nAdd the\nmodprobe.blacklist=\nMODULE_NAME\ncommand to the end of the line. For example:\nlinux /boot/vmlinuz...splash= silent quiet showopts modprobe.blacklist=nouveau\nPress\nF10\nor\nCtrl\n–\nX\nto boot with the\n      specified configuration.\nTo blacklist a kernel module permanently via GRUB, open the\n/etc/default/grub\nfile for editing, and add the\nmodprobe.blacklist=\nMODULE_NAME\noption to the\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX\ncommand. Then run the\nsudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg\ncommand to enable\n      the changes.\nOn this page\n28.1\nListing loaded modules with lsmod and modinfo\n28.2\nAdding and removing kernel modules\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

Changes\n  in the device state (whether a device is plugged in or removed) need to be\n  propagated to user space. Devices need to be configured when they are\n  plugged in and recognized. Users of a certain device need to be informed\n  about any changes in this device's recognized state.\nudev\nprovides the needed\n  infrastructure to dynamically maintain the device node files and symbolic\n  links in the\n/dev\ndirectory.\nudev\nrules provide a way to plug\n  external tools into the kernel device event processing. This allows you to\n  customize\nudev\ndevice handling by adding certain scripts to execute as part of kernel device\n  handling, or request and import additional data to evaluate during device\n  handling.\n29.1\nThe\n/dev\ndirectory\n#\nThe device nodes in the\n/dev\ndirectory provide access\n   to the corresponding kernel devices. With\nudev\n, the\n/dev\ndirectory reflects the current state of the kernel. Every kernel device has\n   one corresponding device file. If a device is disconnected from the system,\n   the device node is removed.\nThe content of the\n/dev\ndirectory is kept on a\n   temporary file system and all files are rendered at every system start-up.\n   Manually created or modified files do not, by design, survive a reboot.\n   Static files and directories that should always be in the\n/dev\ndirectory regardless of the state of the\n   corresponding kernel device can be created with systemd-tmpfiles. The\n   configuration files are found in\n/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/\nand\n/etc/tmpfiles.d/\n; for more information, see the\nsystemd-tmpfiles(8)\nman page.\n29.2\nKernel\nuevents\nand\nudev\n#\nThe required device information is exported by the\nsysfs\nfile system. For every\n   device the kernel has detected and initialized, a directory with the device\n   name is created. It contains attribute files with device-specific\n   properties.\nEvery time a device is added or removed, the kernel sends a uevent to notify\nudev\nof the change. The\nudev\ndaemon reads and parses all\n   rules from the\n/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/*.rules\nand\n/etc/udev/rules.d/*.rules\nfiles at start-up and keeps\n   them in memory. If rules files are changed, added or removed, the daemon can\n   reload their in-memory representation with the command\nudevadm control --reload\n. For more details on\nudev\nrules and their syntax, refer\n   to\nSection 29.6, “Influencing kernel device event handling with\nudev\nrules”\n.\nEvery received event is matched against the set of provides rules. The rules\n   can add or change event environment keys, request a specific name for the\n   device node to create, add symbolic links pointing to the node or add\n   programs to run after the device node is created. The driver core\nuevents\nare received from a kernel\n   netlink socket.\n29.3\nDrivers, kernel modules and devices\n#\nThe kernel bus drivers probe for devices. For every detected device, the\n   kernel creates an internal device structure while the driver core sends a\n   uevent to the\nudev\ndaemon. Bus\n   devices identify themselves by a specially-formatted ID, which tells what\n   kind of device it is. Usually these IDs consist of vendor and product ID and\n   other subsystem-specific values. Every bus has its own scheme for these IDs,\n   called\nMODALIAS\n. The kernel takes the device information,\n   composes a\nMODALIAS\nID string from it and sends that string\n   along with the event. For a USB mouse, it looks like this:\nMODALIAS=usb:v046DpC03Ed2000dc00dsc00dp00ic03isc01ip02\nEvery device driver carries a list of known aliases for devices it can\n   handle. The list is contained in the kernel module file itself. The program\n   depmod reads the ID lists and creates the file\nmodules.alias\nin the kernel's\n/lib/modules\ndirectory for all currently available\n   modules. With this infrastructure, module loading is as easy as calling\nmodprobe\nfor every event that carries a\nMODALIAS\nkey. If\nmodprobe $MODALIAS\nis\n   called, it matches the device alias composed for the device with the aliases\n   provided by the modules. If a matching entry is found, that module is\n   loaded. All this is automatically triggered by\nudev\n.\n29.4\nBooting and initial device setup\n#\nAll device events happening during the boot process before the\nudev\ndaemon is running are lost,\n   because the infrastructure to handle these events resides on the root file\n   system and is not available at that time. To cover that loss, the kernel\n   provides a\nuevent\nfile located in the device directory\n   of every device in the\nsysfs\nfile system. By writing\nadd\nto that file, the kernel\n   resends the same event as the one lost during boot. A simple loop over all\nuevent\nfiles in\n/sys\ntriggers all\n   events again to create the device nodes and perform device setup.\nAs an example, a USB mouse present during boot may not be initialized by the\n   early boot logic, because the driver is not available at that time. The\n   event for the device discovery was lost and failed to find a kernel module\n   for the device. Instead of manually searching for connected\n   devices,\nudev\nrequests all device\n   events from the kernel after the root file system is available, so the event\n   for the USB mouse device runs again. Now it finds the kernel module on the\n   mounted root file system and the USB mouse can be initialized.\nFrom user space, there is no visible difference between a device coldplug\n   sequence and a device discovery during runtime. In both cases, the same\n   rules are used to match and the same configured programs are run.\n29.5\nMonitoring the running\nudev\ndaemon\n#\nThe program\nudevadm monitor\ncan be used to visualize the\n   driver core events and the timing of the\nudev\nevent processes.\nUEVENT[1185238505.276660] add   /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.2/usb3/3-1 (usb)\nUDEV  [1185238505.279198] add   /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.2/usb3/3-1 (usb)\nUEVENT[1185238505.279527] add   /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.2/usb3/3-1/3-1:1.0 (usb)\nUDEV  [1185238505.285573] add   /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.2/usb3/3-1/3-1:1.0 (usb)\nUEVENT[1185238505.298878] add   /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.2/usb3/3-1/3-1:1.0/input/input10 (input)\nUDEV  [1185238505.305026] add   /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.2/usb3/3-1/3-1:1.0/input/input10 (input)\nUEVENT[1185238505.305442] add   /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.2/usb3/3-1/3-1:1.0/input/input10/mouse2 (input)\nUEVENT[1185238505.306440] add   /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.2/usb3/3-1/3-1:1.0/input/input10/event4 (input)\nUDEV  [1185238505.325384] add   /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.2/usb3/3-1/3-1:1.0/input/input10/event4 (input)\nUDEV  [1185238505.342257] add   /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.2/usb3/3-1/3-1:1.0/input/input10/mouse2 (input)\nThe\nUEVENT\nlines show the events the kernel has sent over\n   netlink. The\nUDEV\nlines show the finished\nudev\nevent handlers. The timing is\n   printed in microseconds. The time between\nUEVENT\nand\nUDEV\nis the time\nudev\ntook to process this event or\n   the\nudev\ndaemon has delayed its\n   execution to synchronize this event with related and already running events.\n   For example, events for hard disk partitions always wait for the main disk\n   device event to finish, because the partition events may rely on the data\n   that the main disk event has queried from the hardware.\nudevadm monitor --env\nshows the complete event\n   environment:\nACTION=add\nDEVPATH=/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.2/usb3/3-1/3-1:1.0/input/input10\nSUBSYSTEM=input\nSEQNUM=1181\nNAME=\"Logitech USB-PS/2 Optical Mouse\"\nPHYS=\"usb-0000:00:1d.2-1/input0\"\nUNIQ=\"\"\nEV=7\nKEY=70000 0 0 0 0\nREL=103\nMODALIAS=input:b0003v046DpC03Ee0110-e0,1,2,k110,111,112,r0,1,8,amlsfw\nudev\nalso sends messages to syslog.\n   The default syslog priority that controls which messages are sent to syslog\n   is specified in the\nudev\nconfiguration file\n/etc/udev/udev.conf\n. The log\n   priority of the running daemon can be changed with\nudevadm control\n   --log_priority=\nLEVEL/NUMBER\n.\n29.6\nInfluencing kernel device event handling with\nudev\nrules\n#\nA\nudev\nrule can match any property\n   the kernel adds to the event itself or any information that the kernel\n   exports to\nsysfs\n. The rule can also request additional\n   information from external programs. Events are matched against all rules\n   provided in the directories\n/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/\n(for default rules) and\n/etc/udev/rules.d\n(system-specific configuration).\nEvery line in the rules file contains at least one key value pair. There are\n   two kinds of keys, match and assignment keys. If all match keys match their\n   values, the rule is applied and the assignment keys are assigned the\n   specified value. A matching rule may specify the name of the device node,\n   add symbolic links pointing to the node or run a specified program as part\n   of the event handling. If no matching rule is found, the default device node\n   name is used to create the device node. Detailed information about the rule\n   syntax and the provided keys to match or import data are described in the\nudev\nman page. The following\n   example rules provide a basic introduction to\nudev\nrule syntax. The example rules\n   are all taken from the\nudev\ndefault\n   rule set\n/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/50-udev-default.rules\n.\nExample 29.1:\nExample\nudev\nrules\n#\n# console\nKERNEL==\"console\", MODE=\"0600\", OPTIONS=\"last_rule\"\n\n# serial devices\nKERNEL==\"ttyUSB*\", ATTRS{product}==\"[Pp]alm*Handheld*\", SYMLINK+=\"pilot\"\n\n# printer\nSUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", KERNEL==\"lp*\", NAME=\"usb/%k\", SYMLINK+=\"usb%k\", GROUP=\"lp\"\n\n# kernel firmware loader\nSUBSYSTEM==\"firmware\", ACTION==\"add\", RUN+=\"firmware.sh\"\nThe\nconsole\nrule consists of three keys: one match\n   key (\nKERNEL\n) and two assign keys\n   (\nMODE\n,\nOPTIONS\n). The\nKERNEL\nmatch rule searches the device list for any items\n   of the type\nconsole\n. Only exact matches are valid and\n   trigger this rule to be executed. The\nMODE\nkey assigns\n   special permissions to the device node, in this case, read and write\n   permissions to the owner of this device only. The\nOPTIONS\nkey makes this rule the last rule to be applied to any device of this type.\n   Any later rule matching this particular device type does not have any\n   effect.\nThe\nserial devices\nrule is not available in\n50-udev-default.rules\nanymore, but it is still worth\n   considering. It consists of two match keys (\nKERNEL\nand\nATTRS\n) and one assign key (\nSYMLINK\n).\n   The\nKERNEL\nkey searches for all devices of the\nttyUSB\ntype. Using the\n*\nwild card,\n   this key matches several of these devices. The second match key,\nATTRS\n, checks whether the\nproduct\nattribute file in\nsysfs\nfor any\nttyUSB\ndevice contains a certain string. The assign key\n   (\nSYMLINK\n) triggers the addition of a symbolic link to\n   this device under\n/dev/pilot\n. The operator used in this\n   key (\n+=\n) tells\nudev\nto additionally perform this\n   action, even if previous or later rules add other symbolic links. As this\n   rule contains two match keys, it is only applied if both conditions are met.\nThe\nprinter\nrule deals with USB printers and\n   contains two match keys which must both apply to get the entire rule applied\n   (\nSUBSYSTEM\nand\nKERNEL\n). Three assign\n   keys deal with the naming for this device type (\nNAME\n),\n   the creation of symbolic device links (\nSYMLINK\n) and the\n   group membership for this device type (\nGROUP\n). Using the\n*\nwild card in the\nKERNEL\nkey makes it\n   match several\nlp\nprinter devices. Substitutions are used\n   in both, the\nNAME\nand the\nSYMLINK\nkeys\n   to extend these strings by the internal device name. For example, the\n   symbolic link to the first\nlp\nUSB printer would read\n/dev/usblp0\n.\nThe\nkernel firmware loader\nrule makes\nudev\nload additional firmware by an\n   external helper script during runtime. The\nSUBSYSTEM\nmatch key searches for the\nfirmware\nsubsystem. The\nACTION\nkey checks whether any device belonging to the\nfirmware\nsubsystem has been added. The\nRUN+=\nkey triggers the execution of the\nfirmware.sh\nscript to locate the firmware that is to be\n   loaded.\nSome general characteristics are common to all rules:\nEach rule consists of one or more key value pairs separated by a comma.\nA key's operation is determined by the operator.\nudev\nrules support several\n     operators.\nEach given value must be enclosed by quotation marks.\nEach line of the rules file represents one rule. If a rule is longer than\n     one line, use\n\\\nto join the different lines as you\n     would do in shell syntax.\nudev\nrules support a shell-style\n     pattern that matches the\n*\n,\n?\n, and\n[]\npatterns.\nudev\nrules support substitutions.\n29.6.1\nUsing operators in\nudev\nrules\n#\nCreating keys you can choose from several operators, depending on the type\n    of key you want to create. Match keys will normally be used to find a value\n    that either matches or explicitly mismatches the search value. Match keys\n    contain either of the following operators:\n==\nCompare for equality. If the key contains a search pattern, all results\n       matching this pattern are valid.\n!=\nCompare for non-equality. If the key contains a search pattern, all\n       results matching this pattern are valid.\nAny of the following operators can be used with assign keys:\n=\nAssign a value to a key. If the key previously consisted of a list of\n       values, the key resets and only the single value is assigned.\n+=\nAdd a value to a key that contains a list of entries.\n:=\nAssign a final value. Disallow any later change by later rules.\n29.6.2\nUsing substitutions in\nudev\nrules\n#\nudev\nrules support the use of\n    placeholders and substitutions. Use them in a similar fashion as you would\n    do in any other scripts. The following substitutions can be used with\nudev\nrules:\n%r\n,\n$root\nThe device directory,\n/dev\nby default.\n%p\n,\n$devpath\nThe value of\nDEVPATH\n.\n%k\n,\n$kernel\nThe value of\nKERNEL\nor the internal device name.\n%n\n,\n$number\nThe device number.\n%N\n,\n$tempnode\nThe temporary name of the device file.\n%M\n,\n$major\nThe major number of the device.\n%m\n,\n$minor\nThe minor number of the device.\n%s{\nATTRIBUTE\n}\n,\n$attr{\nATTRIBUTE\n}\nThe value of a\nsysfs\nattribute (specified by\nATTRIBUTE\n).\n%E{\nVARIABLE\n}\n,\n$env{\nVARIABLE\n}\nThe value of an environment variable (specified by\nVARIABLE\n).\n%c\n,\n$result\nThe output of\nPROGRAM\n.\n%%\nThe\n%\ncharacter.\n$$\nThe\n$\ncharacter.\n29.6.3\nUsing\nudev\nmatch keys\n#\nMatch keys describe conditions that must be met before a\nudev\nrule can be applied. The\n    following match keys are available:\nACTION\nThe name of the event action, for example,\nadd\nor\nremove\nwhen adding or removing a device.\nDEVPATH\nThe device path of the event device, for example,\nDEVPATH=/bus/pci/drivers/ipw3945\nto search for all\n       events related to the ipw3945 driver.\nKERNEL\nThe internal (kernel) name of the event device.\nSUBSYSTEM\nThe subsystem of the event device, for example,\nSUBSYSTEM=usb\nfor all events related to USB devices.\nATTR{\nFILENAME\n}\nsysfs\nattributes of the\n       event device. To match a string contained in the\nvendor\nattribute file name, you could use\nATTR{vendor}==\"On[sS]tream\"\n, for example.\nKERNELS\nLet\nudev\nsearch the device path\n       upward for a matching device name.\nSUBSYSTEMS\nLet\nudev\nsearch the device path\n       upward for a matching device subsystem name.\nDRIVERS\nLet\nudev\nsearch the device path\n       upward for a matching device driver name.\nATTRS{\nFILENAME\n}\nLet\nudev\nsearch the device path\n       upward for a device with matching\nsysfs\nattribute values.\nENV{\nKEY\n}\nThe value of an environment variable, for example,\nENV{ID_BUS}=\"ieee1394\nto search for all events\n       related to the FireWire bus ID.\nPROGRAM\nLet\nudev\nexecute an external\n       program. To be successful, the program must return with exit code zero.\n       The program's output, printed to STDOUT, is available to the\nRESULT\nkey.\nRESULT\nMatch the output string of the last\nPROGRAM\ncall.\n       Either include this key in the same rule as the\nPROGRAM\nkey or in a later one.\n29.6.4\nUsing\nudev\nassign keys\n#\nIn contrast to the match keys described above, assign keys do not describe\n    conditions that must be met. They assign values, names and actions to the\n    device nodes maintained by\nudev\n.\nNAME\nThe name of the device node to be created. After a rule has set a node\n       name, all other rules with a\nNAME\nkey for this node\n       are ignored.\nSYMLINK\nThe name of a symbolic link related to the node to be created. Multiple\n       matching rules can add symbolic links to be created with the device\n       node. You can also specify multiple symbolic links for one node in one\n       rule using the space character to separate the symbolic link names.\nOWNER, GROUP, MODE\nThe permissions for the new device node. Values specified here overwrite\n       anything that has been compiled in.\nATTR{\nKEY\n}\nSpecify a value to be written to a\nsysfs\nattribute of the event\n       device. If the\n==\noperator is used, this key is also\n       used to match against the value of a\nsysfs\nattribute.\nENV{\nKEY\n}\nTell\nudev\nto export a variable\n       to the environment. If the\n==\noperator is used, this\n       key is also used to match against an environment variable.\nRUN\nTell\nudev\nto add a program to\n       the list of programs to be executed for this device. Keep in mind to\n       restrict this to very short tasks to avoid blocking further events for\n       this device.\nLABEL\nAdd a label where a\nGOTO\ncan jump to.\nGOTO\nTell\nudev\nto skip several\n       rules and continue with the one that carries the label referenced by the\nGOTO\nkey.\nIMPORT{\nTYPE\n}\nLoad variables into the event environment such as the output of an\n       external program.\nudev\nimports\n       variables of several types. If no type is specified,\nudev\ntries to determine the\n       type itself based on the executable bit of the file permissions.\nprogram\ntells\nudev\nto execute an external\n         program and import its output.\nfile\ntells\nudev\nto import a text file.\nparent\ntells\nudev\nto import the stored\n         keys from the parent device.\nWAIT_FOR_SYSFS\nTells\nudev\nto wait for the\n       specified\nsysfs\nfile to be\n       created for a certain device. For example,\nWAIT_FOR_SYSFS=\"ioerr_cnt\"\ninforms\nudev\nto wait until the\nioerr_cnt\nfile has been created.\nOPTIONS\nThe\nOPTION\nkey may have several values:\nlast_rule\ntells\nudev\nto ignore all later\n         rules.\nignore_device\ntells\nudev\nto ignore this event\n         completely.\nignore_remove\ntells\nudev\nto ignore all later\n         remove events for the device.\nall_partitions\ntells\nudev\nto create device nodes\n         for all available partitions on a block device.\n29.7\nPersistent device naming\n#\nThe dynamic device directory and the\nudev\nrules infrastructure make it\n   possible to provide stable names for all disk devices—regardless of\n   their order of recognition or the connection used for the device. Every\n   appropriate block device the kernel creates is examined by tools with\n   special knowledge about certain buses, drive types or file systems. Along\n   with the dynamic kernel-provided device node name,\nudev\nmaintains classes of\n   persistent symbolic links pointing to the device:\n/dev/disk\n|-- by-id\n|   |-- scsi-SATA_HTS726060M9AT00_MRH453M4HWHG7B -> ../../sda\n|   |-- scsi-SATA_HTS726060M9AT00_MRH453M4HWHG7B-part1 -> ../../sda1\n|   |-- scsi-SATA_HTS726060M9AT00_MRH453M4HWHG7B-part6 -> ../../sda6\n|   |-- scsi-SATA_HTS726060M9AT00_MRH453M4HWHG7B-part7 -> ../../sda7\n|   |-- usb-Generic_STORAGE_DEVICE_02773 -> ../../sdd\n|   `-- usb-Generic_STORAGE_DEVICE_02773-part1 -> ../../sdd1\n|-- by-label\n|   |-- Photos -> ../../sdd1\n|   |-- SUSE10 -> ../../sda7\n|   `-- devel -> ../../sda6\n|-- by-path\n|   |-- pci-0000:00:1f.2-scsi-0:0:0:0 -> ../../sda\n|   |-- pci-0000:00:1f.2-scsi-0:0:0:0-part1 -> ../../sda1\n|   |-- pci-0000:00:1f.2-scsi-0:0:0:0-part6 -> ../../sda6\n|   |-- pci-0000:00:1f.2-scsi-0:0:0:0-part7 -> ../../sda7\n|   |-- pci-0000:00:1f.2-scsi-1:0:0:0 -> ../../sr0\n|   |-- usb-02773:0:0:2 -> ../../sdd\n|   |-- usb-02773:0:0:2-part1 -> ../../sdd1\n`-- by-uuid\n    |-- 159a47a4-e6e6-40be-a757-a629991479ae -> ../../sda7\n    |-- 3e999973-00c9-4917-9442-b7633bd95b9e -> ../../sda6\n    `-- 4210-8F8C -> ../../sdd1\n29.8\nFiles used by\nudev\n#\n/sys/*\nVirtual file system provided by the Linux kernel, exporting all currently\n      known devices.

We talk about software components\n    like\nbash\n,\ncron\nand\nlogrotate\n, because they were\n    changed or enhanced during the last release cycles. Even if they are small\n    or considered of minor importance, users should change their default\n    behavior, because these components are often closely coupled with the\n    system. The chapter concludes with a section about language and\n    country-specific settings (I18N and L10N).\n30.1\nInformation about special software packages\n#\nThe following chapter provides basic information about the following tools:\nbash\n,\ncron\n,\nlogrotate\n,\nlocate\n,\nulimit\nand\nfree\n.\n30.1.1\nThe\nbash\npackage and\n/etc/profile\n#\nBash is the default system shell. When used as a login shell, it reads\n   several initialization files. Bash processes them in the order they appear\n   in this list:\n/etc/profile\n~/.profile\n/etc/bash.bashrc\n~/.bashrc\nMake custom settings in\n~/.profile\nor\n~/.bashrc\n. To ensure the correct processing of these\n   files, it is necessary to copy the basic settings from\n/etc/skel/.profile\nor\n/etc/skel/.bashrc\ninto the home directory of the user.\n   It is recommended to copy the settings from\n/etc/skel\nafter an update. Execute the following shell commands to prevent the loss of\n   personal adjustments:\n>\nmv ~/.bashrc ~/.bashrc.old\n>\ncp /etc/skel/.bashrc ~/.bashrc\n>\nmv ~/.profile ~/.profile.old\n>\ncp /etc/skel/.profile ~/.profile\nThen copy personal adjustments back from the\n*.old\nfiles.\n30.1.2\nThe\ncron\npackage\n#\nUse\ncron\nto automatically run\n   commands in the background at predefined times.\ncron\nuses specially formatted time tables, and\n   the tool comes with several default ones. Users can also specify custom\n   tables, if needed.\nThe cron tables are located in\n/var/spool/cron/tabs\n.\n/etc/crontab\nserves as a systemwide cron table. Enter\n   the user name to run the command directly after the time table and before\n   the command. In\nExample 30.1, “Entry in /etc/crontab”\n,\nroot\nis entered. Package-specific\n   tables, located in\n/etc/cron.d\n, have the same format.\n   See the\ncron\nman page (\nman cron\n).\nExample 30.1:\nEntry in /etc/crontab\n#\n1-59/5 * * * *   root   test -x /usr/sbin/atrun && /usr/sbin/atrun\nYou cannot edit\n/etc/crontab\nby calling the command\ncrontab -e\n. This file must be loaded directly into an\n   editor, then modified and saved.\nSeveral packages install shell scripts to the directories\n/etc/cron.hourly\n,\n/etc/cron.daily\n,\n/etc/cron.weekly\nand\n/etc/cron.monthly\n, whose execution is controlled by\n/usr/lib/cron/run-crons\n.\n/usr/lib/cron/run-crons\nis run every 15 minutes from\n   the main table (\n/etc/crontab\n). This guarantees that\n   processes that may have been neglected can be run at the proper time.\nTo run the\nhourly\n,\ndaily\nor other\n   periodic maintenance scripts at custom times, remove the time stamp files\n   regularly using\n/etc/crontab\nentries (see\nExample 30.2, “/etc/crontab: remove time stamp files”\n, which removes the\nhourly\none before every full hour, the\ndaily\none once a day at 2:14 a.m., etc.).\nExample 30.2:\n/etc/crontab: remove time stamp files\n#\n59 *  * * *     root  rm -f /var/spool/cron/lastrun/cron.hourly\n14 2  * * *     root  rm -f /var/spool/cron/lastrun/cron.daily\n29 2  * * 6     root  rm -f /var/spool/cron/lastrun/cron.weekly\n44 2  1 * *     root  rm -f /var/spool/cron/lastrun/cron.monthly\nOr you can set\nDAILY_TIME\nin\n/etc/sysconfig/cron\nto the time at which\ncron.daily\nshould start. The setting of\nMAX_NOT_RUN\nensures that the daily tasks get triggered to\n   run, even if the user did not turn on the computer at the specified\nDAILY_TIME\nfor a longer time. The maximum value of\nMAX_NOT_RUN\nis 14 days.\n30.1.3\nStopping cron status messages\n#\nTo avoid the mail flood caused by cron status messages, the default value of\nSEND_MAIL_ON_NO_ERROR\nin\n/etc/sysconfig/cron\nis set to \"\nno\n\"\n   for new installations. Even with this setting to \"\nno\n\",\n   cron data output will still be sent to the\nMAILTO\naddress, as documented in the cron man page.\nIn the update case it is recommended to set these values according to your\n   needs.\n30.1.4\nLog files: package logrotate\n#\nThere are several system services (\ndaemons\n) that, along\n  with the kernel itself, regularly record the system status and specific\n  events onto log files. This way, the administrator can regularly check the\n  status of the system at a certain point in time, recognize errors or faulty\n  functions and troubleshoot them with pinpoint precision. These log files are\n  normally stored in\n/var/log\nas specified by FHS and grow\n  on a daily basis. The\nlogrotate\npackage helps\n  control the growth of these files. For more details refer to\nSection 3.3, “Managing log files with\nlogrotate\n”\n.\n30.1.5\nThe\nlocate\ncommand\n#\nlocate\n, a command for quickly finding files, is not\n   included in the standard scope of installed software. If desired, install\n   the package\nmlocate\n, the successor of the package\nfindutils-locate\n. The\nupdatedb\nprocess is started\n   automatically every night or about 15 minutes after booting the system.\n30.1.6\nThe\nulimit\ncommand\n#\nWith the\nulimit\n(\nuser limits\n)\n   command, it is possible to set limits for the use of system resources and to\n   have these displayed.\nulimit\nis especially useful for\n   limiting available memory for applications. With this, an application can be\n   prevented from co-opting too much of the system resources and slowing or\n   even hanging up the operating system.\nulimit\ncan be used with various options. To limit memory\n   usage, use the options listed in\nTable 30.1, “\nulimit\n: Setting resources for the user”\n.\nTable 30.1:\nulimit\n: Setting resources for the user\n#\n-m\nThe maximum resident set size\n-v\nThe maximum amount of virtual memory available to the shell\n-s\nThe maximum size of the stack\n-c\nThe maximum size of core files created\n-a\nAll current limits are reported\nSystemwide default entries are set in\n/etc/profile\n.\n   Editing this file directly is not recommended, because changes will be\n   overwritten during system upgrades. To customize systemwide profile\n   settings, use\n/etc/profile.local\n. Per-user settings\n   should be made in\n~\nUSER\n/.profile\n.\nExample 30.3:\nulimit\n: Settings in\n~/.bashrc\n#\n# Limits maximum resident set size (physical memory):\nulimit -m 98304\n\n# Limits of virtual memory:\nulimit -v 98304\nMemory allocations must be specified in KB. For more detailed information,\n   see\nman bash\n.\nImportant:\nulimit\nsupport\nNot all shells support\nulimit\ndirectives. PAM (for\n    example,\npam_limits\n) offers comprehensive adjustment\n    possibilities as an alternative to\nulimit\n.\n30.1.7\nThe\nfree\ncommand\n#\nThe\nfree\ncommand displays the total amount of free and\n   used physical memory and swap space in the system and the buffers and\n   cache consumed by the kernel. The concept of\navailable\n   RAM\ndates back to before the days of unified memory management.\n   The slogan\nfree memory is bad memory\napplies well to\n   Linux. As a result, Linux has always made the effort to balance out caches\n   without actually allowing free or unused memory.\nThe kernel does not have direct knowledge of any applications or user data.\n   Instead, it manages applications and user data in a\npage\n   cache\n. If memory runs short, parts of it are written to the swap\n   partition or to files, from which they can initially be read using the\nmmap\ncommand (see\nman mmap\n).\nThe kernel also contains other caches, such as the\nslab\n   cache\n, where the caches used for network access are stored. This\n   may explain the differences between the counters in\n/proc/meminfo\n. Most, but not all, of them can be\n   accessed via\n/proc/slabinfo\n.\nHowever, if your goal is to find out how much RAM is currently being used,\n   find this information in\n/proc/meminfo\n.\n30.1.8\nMan pages and info pages\n#\nFor some GNU applications (such as tar), the man pages are no longer\n   maintained. For these commands, use the\n--help\noption to\n   get a quick overview of the info pages, which provide more in-depth\n   instructions. Info\n\n   is GNU's hypertext system. Read an introduction to this system by entering\ninfo\ninfo\n. Info pages can be viewed with\n   Emacs by entering\nemacs\n-f info\nor\n   directly in a console with\ninfo\n. You can also use tkinfo,\n   xinfo or the help system to view info pages.\n30.1.9\nSelecting man pages using the\nman\ncommand\n#\nTo read a man page enter\nman\nMAN_PAGE\n. If a man page with the same name exists\n   in different sections, they will all be listed with the corresponding\n   section numbers. Select the one to display. If you do not enter a section\n   number within a few seconds, the first man page will be displayed.\nTo change this to the default system behavior, set\nMAN_POSIXLY_CORRECT=1\nin a shell initialization file such\n   as\n~/.bashrc\n.\n30.1.10\nSettings for GNU Emacs\n#\nGNU Emacs is a complex work environment. The following sections cover the\n  configuration files processed when GNU Emacs is started. More information is\n  available at\nhttp://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/\n.\nOn start-up, Emacs reads several files containing the settings of the user,\n  system administrator and distributor for customization or preconfiguration.\n  The initialization file\n~/.emacs\nis installed to the\n  home directories of the individual users from\n/etc/skel\n.\n.emacs\n, in turn, reads the file\n/etc/skel/.gnu-emacs\n. To customize the program, copy\n.gnu-emacs\nto the home directory (with\ncp\n  /etc/skel/.gnu-emacs ~/.gnu-emacs\n) and make the desired settings\n  there.\n.gnu-emacs\ndefines the file\n~/.gnu-emacs-custom\nas\ncustom-file\n.\n  If users make settings with the\ncustomize\noptions in\n  Emacs, the settings are saved to\n~/.gnu-emacs-custom\n.\nWith\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n, the\nemacs\npackage installs the file\nsite-start.el\nin the directory\n/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp\n. The file\nsite-start.el\nis loaded before the initialization file\n~/.emacs\n. Among other things,\nsite-start.el\nensures that special configuration files\n  distributed with Emacs add-on packages, such as\npsgml\n, are loaded automatically.\n  Configuration files of this type are located in\n/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp\n, too, and always begin with\nsuse-start-\n. The local system administrator can specify\n  systemwide settings in\ndefault.el\n.\nMore information about these files is available in the Emacs info file under\nInit File\n:\ninfo:/emacs/InitFile\n.\n  Information about how to disable the loading of these files (if necessary) is\n  also provided at this location.\nThe components of Emacs are divided into several packages:\nThe base package\nemacs\n.\nemacs-x11\n(usually installed):\n    the program\nwith\nX11 support.\nemacs-nox\n: the program\nwithout\nX11 support.\nemacs-info\n: online documentation\n    in info format.\nemacs-el\n: the uncompiled library\n    files in Emacs Lisp. These are not required at runtime.\nNumerous add-on packages can be installed if needed:\nemacs-auctex\n(LaTeX),\npsgml\n(SGML and XML),\ngnuserv\n(client and server\n    operation) and others.\n30.2\nVirtual consoles\n#\nLinux is a multiuser and multitasking system. The advantages of these\n  features can be appreciated even on a stand-alone PC system. In text mode,\n  there are six virtual consoles available. Switch between them using\nAlt\n–\nF1\nthrough\nAlt\n–\nF6\n. The\n  seventh console is reserved for X and the tenth console shows kernel\n  messages.\nTo switch to a console from X without shutting it down, use\nCtrl\n–\nAlt\n–\nF1\nto\nCtrl\n–\nAlt\n–\nF6\n. To return to X,\n  press\nAlt\n–\nF7\n.\n30.3\nKeyboard mapping\n#\nTo standardize the keyboard mapping of programs, changes were made to the\n  following files:\n/etc/inputrc\n/etc/X11/Xmodmap\n/etc/skel/.emacs\n/etc/skel/.gnu-emacs\n/etc/skel/.vimrc\n/etc/csh.cshrc\n/etc/termcap\n/usr/share/terminfo/x/xterm\n/usr/share/X11/app-defaults/XTerm\n/usr/share/emacs/\nVERSION\n/site-lisp/term/*.el\nThese changes only affect applications that use\nterminfo\nentries or whose configuration files are changed directly\n  (\nvi\n,\nemacs\n, etc.). Applications not\n  shipped with the system should be adapted to these defaults.\nUnder X, the compose key (multikey) can be enabled as explained in\n/etc/X11/Xmodmap\n.\nFurther settings are possible using the X Keyboard Extension (XKB).\nTip: More information\nInformation about XKB is available in the documents listed in\n/usr/share/doc/packages/xkeyboard-config\n(part of the\nxkeyboard-config\npackage).\n30.4\nLanguage and country-specific settings\n#\nThe system is, to a very large extent, internationalized and can be modified\n  for local needs. Internationalization (\nI18N\n) allows\n  specific localization (\nL10N\n). The abbreviations I18N and\n  L10N are derived from the first and last letters of the words and, in\n  between, the number of letters omitted.\nSettings are made with\nLC_\nvariables defined in the\n  file\n/etc/sysconfig/language\n. This refers not only to\nnative language support\n, but also to the categories\nMessages\n(Language),\nCharacter Set\n,\nSort Order\n,\nTime and Date\n,\nNumbers\nand\nMoney\n. Each of these\n  categories can be defined directly with its own variable or indirectly with a\n  master variable in the file\nlanguage\n(see the\nlocale\nman page).\nList of variables\n#\nRC_LC_MESSAGES\n,\nRC_LC_CTYPE\n,\nRC_LC_COLLATE\n,\nRC_LC_TIME\n,\nRC_LC_NUMERIC\n,\nRC_LC_MONETARY\nThese variables are passed to the shell without the\nRC_\nprefix and represent the listed categories.\n     The shell profiles concerned are listed below. The current setting can be\n     shown with the command\nlocale\n.\nRC_LC_ALL\nThis variable, if set, overwrites the values of the variables already\n     mentioned.\nRC_LANG\nIf none of the previous variables are set, this is the fallback. By\n     default, only\nRC_LANG\nis set. This makes it\n     easier for users to enter their own values.\nROOT_USES_LANG\nThis variable can be set to\nyes\nor\nctype\n(default). If set to\nyes\n,\nroot\nuses language and country-specific settings, otherwise the system administrator\n      always works in a POSIX environment.\nThe variables can be set with the YaST sysconfig editor. The value of such\n  a variable contains the language code, country code, encoding and modifier.\n  The individual components are joined by special characters:\nLANG=<language>[[_<COUNTRY>].<Encoding>[@<Modifier>]]\n30.4.1\nSystem-wide locale settings\n#\nsystemd\nreads\n/etc/locale.conf\nat early boot. The locale settings configured in this file are\n   inherited by every service or user, unless there are individual\n   settings.\nNote: Behavior of older configuration files under\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nEarlier versions of\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nread locale settings from\n/etc/sysconfig/language\n,\n/etc/sysconfig/keyboard\n, and\n/etc/sysconfig/console\n.\n    Starting with\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n15 GA\n,\n    these files are considered obsolete.\nsystemd\ndoes not read settings from these files anymore.\n    Instead,\nsystemd\nreads\n/etc/locale.conf\n.\nHowever, variables defined in\n/etc/sysconfig/language\nwill still be used: They override the system-wide locale and can be used to\n    define different locale settings for user shells (see\nSection 30.4.2, “Some examples”\n).\nTo set the system-wide locale, you can either:\nWrite your settings in\n/etc/locale.conf\n.\n     Each line is a environment-like variable assignment (see\nman 5 locale.conf\nfor a list of variables):\nLANG=de_DE.UTF-8\nTo fine-tune the settings, you can add additional variables,\n     one variable per line.\nUse the command\nlocalectl\n:\n#\nlocalectl\nset-locale LANG=de_DE.UTF-8\nSame here, you can also specify additional variables after the\nlocalectl set-locale\ncommand.\nTo keep backward compatibility with old systems during the\n   update of the systemd package, all variables mentioned will be migrated\n   from sysconfig to their final destinations if they are not already defined\n   there.\n30.4.2\nSome examples\n#\nYou should always set the language and country codes together. Language\n   settings follow the standard ISO 639 available at\nhttp://www.evertype.com/standards/iso639/iso639-en.html\nand\nhttp://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/\n. Country\n   codes are listed in ISO 3166, see\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166\n.\nIt only makes sense to set values for which usable description files can be\n   found in\n/usr/lib/locale\n. Additional description files\n   can be created from the files in\n/usr/share/i18n\nusing\n   the command\nlocaledef\n. The description files are part of\n   the\nglibc-i18ndata\npackage. A description file for\nen_US.UTF-8\n(for English and United States) can be\n   created with:\nlocaledef -i en_US -f UTF-8 en_US.UTF-8\nLANG=en_US.UTF-8\nThis is the default setting if American English is selected during\n      installation. If you selected another language, that language is enabled\n      but still with UTF-8 as the character encoding.\nLANG=en_US.ISO-8859-1\nThis sets the language to English, country to United States and the\n      character set to\nISO-8859-1\n. This character set does\n      not support the Euro sign, but it can be useful sometimes for programs\n      that have not been updated to support\nUTF-8\n. The\n      string defining the charset (\nISO-8859-1\nin this case)\n      is then evaluated by programs like Emacs.\nLANG=en_IE@euro\nThe above example explicitly includes the Euro sign in a language\n      setting. This setting is obsolete now, as UTF-8 also covers the Euro\n      symbol. It is only useful if an application supports ISO-8859-15 and not\n      UTF-8.\nChanges to\n/etc/sysconfig/language\nare activated by the\n   following process chain:\nFor the Bash:\n/etc/profile\nreads\n/etc/profile.d/lang.sh\nwhich, in turn, analyzes\n/etc/sysconfig/language\n.\nFor tcsh: At login,\n/etc/csh.login\nreads\n/etc/profile.d/lang.csh\nwhich, in turn, analyzes\n/etc/sysconfig/language\n.\nThis ensures that any changes to\n/etc/sysconfig/language\nare available at the next login\n   to the respective shell, without having to manually activate\n   them.\nUsers can override the system defaults by editing their\n~/.bashrc\naccordingly. For example, if you do not want\n   to use the system-wide\nen_US\nfor program messages,\n   include\nLC_MESSAGES=es_ES\nso that messages are\n   displayed in Spanish instead.\n30.4.3\nLocale settings in\n~/.i18n\n#\nIf you are not satisfied with locale system defaults, change the settings in\n~/.i18n\naccording to the Bash scripting syntax. Entries\n   in\n~/.i18n\noverride system defaults from\n/etc/sysconfig/language\n. Use the same variable names\n   but without the\nRC_\nnamespace prefixes. For example, use\nLANG\ninstead of\nRC_LANG\n:\nLANG=cs_CZ.UTF-8\nLC_COLLATE=C\n30.4.4\nSettings for language support\n#\nFiles in the category\nMessages\nare, as a rule, only\n   stored in the corresponding language directory (like\nen\n) to have a fallback. If you set\nLANG\nto\nen_US\nand the message\n   file in\n/usr/share/locale/en_US/LC_MESSAGES\ndoes not\n   exist, it falls back to\n/usr/share/locale/en/LC_MESSAGES\n.\nA fallback chain can also be defined, for example, for Breton to French or\n   for Galician to Spanish to Portuguese:\nLANGUAGE=\"br_FR:fr_FR\"\nLANGUAGE=\"gl_ES:es_ES:pt_PT\"\nIf desired, use the Norwegian variants Nynorsk and Bokmål instead (with\n   additional fallback to\nno\n):\nLANG=\"nn_NO\"\nLANGUAGE=\"nn_NO:nb_NO:no\"\nor\nLANG=\"nb_NO\"\nLANGUAGE=\"nb_NO:nn_NO:no\"\nNote that in Norwegian,\nLC_TIME\nis also treated\n   differently.\nOne problem that can arise is a separator used to delimit groups of digits\n   not being recognized properly. This occurs if\nLANG\nis set to only a two-letter language code like\nde\n, but\n   the definition file glibc uses is located in\n/usr/share/lib/de_DE/LC_NUMERIC\n. Thus\nLC_NUMERIC\nmust be set to\nde_DE\nto make the separator definition visible to the system.\n30.4.5\nMore information\n#\nThe GNU C Library Reference Manual\n, Chapter\n“\nLocales and Internationalization\n”\n.

It\n  supports state-of-the-art encryption types and standards for network\n  connections, including connections to 802.1X protected networks. 802.1X is\n  the\n“\nIEEE Standard for Local and Metropolitan Area\n  Networks—Port-Based Network Access Control\n”\n. With NetworkManager, you need\n  not worry about configuring network interfaces and switching between wired or\n  wireless networks when you are on the move. NetworkManager can automatically connect to\n  known wireless networks or manage several network connections in\n  parallel—the fastest connection is then used as default. Furthermore,\n  you can manually switch between available networks and manage your network\n  connection using an applet in the system tray.\nInstead of only one connection being active, multiple connections may be\n  active at once. This enables you to unplug your laptop from an Ethernet and\n  remain connected via a wireless connection.\nImportant\nNetworkManager is only supported by SUSE for desktop workloads with SLED or the\n Workstation extension. All server certifications are done with\nwicked\nas the network configuration tool, and using NetworkManager may\n invalidate them. NetworkManager is not supported by SUSE for server workloads.\n31.1\nUse cases for NetworkManager\n#\nNetworkManager provides a sophisticated and intuitive user interface, which enables\n   users to easily switch their network environment. However, NetworkManager is not a\n   suitable solution in the following cases:\nYour computer provides network services for other computers in your\n     network, for example, it is a DHCP or DNS server.\nYour computer is a Xen server or your system is a virtual system inside\n     Xen.\n31.2\nEnabling or disabling NetworkManager\n#\nOn desktop and laptop computers, NetworkManager is enabled by default. You can disable and enable it at any time using the Network Settings module in YaST.\nRun YaST and go to\nSystem\n›\nNetwork Settings\n.\nThe\nNetwork Settings\ndialog opens. Go to the\nGlobal Options\ntab.\nTo configure and manage your network connections with NetworkManager:\nIn the\nNetwork Setup Method\nfield, select\nUser Controlled with NetworkManager\n.\nClick\nOK\nand close YaST.\nConfigure your network connections with NetworkManager as described in\nSection 31.3, “Configuring network connections”\n.\nTo deactivate NetworkManager and control the network with your own configuration:\nIn the\nNetwork Setup Method\nfield, choose\nControlled by wicked\n.\nClick\nOK\n.\nSet up your network card with YaST using automatic configuration via\n       DHCP or a static IP address.\nFind a detailed description of the network configuration with YaST in\nSection 23.4, “Configuring a network connection with YaST”\n.\n31.3\nConfiguring network connections\n#\nAfter enabling NetworkManager in YaST, configure your network connections with\n   the NetworkManager front-end available in GNOME. It shows tabs for all types of\n   network connections, such as wired, wireless, mobile broadband, DSL, and VPN\n   connections.\nTip: NetworkManager connection editor\nIn previous\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nreleases, network connections were configured\n    using an application called\nNetworkManager Connection Editor\n.\n    This is no longer installed by default, because\nGNOME Control\n     Center\nhas fully replaced its configuration capabilities.\nIf you still need to use NetworkManager Connection Editor to configure network\n    connections, install the\nNetworkManager-connection-editor\npackage manually:\n>\nsudo\nzypper install NetworkManager-connection-editor\nTo open the network configuration dialog in GNOME, open the settings menu\n   via the status menu and click the\nNetwork\nentry.\nNote: Availability of options\nDepending on your system setup, you may not be allowed to configure\n    connections. In a secured environment, some options may be locked or\n    require\nroot\npermission. Ask your system administrator for details.\nFigure 31.1:\nGNOME Network Connections dialog\n#\nProcedure 31.1:\nAdding and editing connections\n#\nOpen the NetworkManager configuration dialog.\nTo add a Connection:\nClick the\n+\nicon in the lower left corner.\nSelect your preferred connection type and follow the instructions.\nWhen you are finished click\nAdd\n.\nAfter confirming your changes, the newly-configured network\n       connection appears in the list of available networks in\n       the Status Menu.\nTo edit a connection:\nSelect the entry to edit.\nClick the gear icon to open the\nConnection Settings\ndialog.\nInsert your changes and click\nApply\nto save them.\nTo make your connection available as a system connection go to the\nIdentity\ntab and set the check box\nMake\n       available to other users\n. For more information about user and\n       system connections, see\nSection 31.4.1, “User and system connections”\n.\n31.3.1\nManaging wired network connections\n#\nIf your computer is connected to a wired network, use the NetworkManager applet to\n    manage the connection.\nOpen the Status Menu and click\nWired\nto change the\n      connection details or to switch it off.\nTo change the settings click\nWired Settings\nand then\n      click the gear icon.\nTo switch off all network connections, activate the\nAirplane\n      Mode\nsetting.\n31.3.2\nManaging wireless network connections\n#\nVisible wireless networks are listed in the GNOME NetworkManager applet menu under\nWireless Networks\n. The signal strength of each network\n    is also shown in the menu. Encrypted wireless networks are marked with a\n    shield icon.\nProcedure 31.2:\nConnecting to a visible wireless network\n#\nTo connect to a visible wireless network, open the Status Menu and click\nWi-Fi\n.\nClick\nTurn On\nto enable it.\nClick\nSelect Network\n, select your Wi-Fi Network and\n      click\nConnect\n.\nIf the network is encrypted, a configuration dialog opens. It shows the\n      type of encryption the network uses and text boxes for entering the login\n      credentials.\nProcedure 31.3:\nConnecting to an invisible wireless network\n#\nTo connect to a network that does not broadcast its service set\n      identifier (SSID or ESSID) and therefore cannot be detected\n      automatically, open the Status Menu and click\nWi-Fi\n.\nClick\nWi-Fi Settings\nto open the detailed settings\n      menu.\nMake sure your Wi-Fi is enabled and click\nConnect to Hidden\n      Network\n.\nIn the dialog that opens, enter the SSID or ESSID in\nNetwork\n      Name\nand set encryption parameters if necessary.\nA wireless network that has been chosen explicitly will remain connected as\n    long as possible. If a network cable is plugged in during that time, any\n    connections that have been set to\nStay connected when\n    possible\nwill be connected, while the wireless connection remains\n    up.\n31.3.3\nConfiguring your Wi-Fi/Bluetooth card as an access point\n#\nIf your Wi-Fi/Bluetooth card supports access point mode, you can use NetworkManager\n    for the configuration.\nOpen the Status Menu and click\nWi-Fi\n.\nClick\nWi-Fi Settings\nto open the detailed settings\n      menu.\nClick\nUse as Hotspot\nand follow the instructions.\nUse the credentials shown in the resulting dialog to connect to the\n      hotspot from a remote machine.\n31.3.4\nNetworkManager and VPN\n#\nNetworkManager supports several Virtual Private Network (VPN) technologies. For each\n    technology,\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\ncomes with a base package providing the generic\n    support for NetworkManager. In addition to that, you also need to install the\n    respective desktop-specific package for your applet.\nOpenVPN\nTo use this VPN technology, install:\nNetworkManager-openvpn\nNetworkManager-openvpn-gnome\nOpenConnect\nTo use this VPN technology, install:\nNetworkManager-openconnect\nNetworkManager-openconnect-gnome\nPPTP (point-to-point tunneling protocol)\nTo use this VPN technology, install:\nNetworkManager-pptp\nNetworkManager-pptp-gnome\nThe following procedure describes how to set up your computer as an OpenVPN\n    client using NetworkManager. Setting up other types of VPNs works analogously.\nBefore you begin, make sure that the package\nNetworkManager-openvpn-gnome\nis\n    installed and all dependencies have been resolved.\nProcedure 31.4:\nSetting up OpenVPN with NetworkManager\n#\nOpen the application\nSettings\nby clicking the status\n      icons at the right end of the panel and clicking the\nwrench and\n      screwdriver\nicon. In the window\nAll Settings\n, choose\nNetwork\n.\nClick the\n+\nicon.\nSelect\nVPN\nand then\nOpenVPN\n.\nChoose the\nAuthentication\ntype. Depending on the\n      setup of your OpenVPN server, choose\nCertificates\n      (TLS)\nor\nPassword with Certificates (TLS)\n.\nInsert the necessary values into the respective text boxes. For our\n      example configuration, these are:\nGateway\nThe remote endpoint of the VPN server\nUser name\nThe user (only available when you have selected\nPassword\n           with Certificates (TLS)\n)\nPassword\nThe password for the user (only available when you have selected\nPassword with Certificates (TLS)\n)\nUser Certificate\n/etc/openvpn/client1.crt\nCA Certificate\n/etc/openvpn/ca.crt\nPrivate Key\n/etc/openvpn/client1.key\nFinish the configuration with\nAdd\n.\nTo enable the connection, in the\nNetwork\npanel of the\nSettings\napplication click the switch button.\n      Alternatively, click the status icons at the right end of the panel, click\n      the name of your VPN and then\nConnect\n.\n31.4\nNetworkManager and security\n#\nNetworkManager distinguishes two types of wireless connections: trusted and untrusted.\n   A trusted connection is any network that you explicitly selected in the\n   past. All others are untrusted. Trusted connections are identified by the\n   name and MAC address of the access point. Using the MAC address ensures that\n   you cannot use a different access point with the name of your trusted\n   connection.\nNetworkManager periodically scans for available wireless networks. If multiple trusted\n   networks are found, the most recently used is automatically selected. NetworkManager\n   waits for your selection in case if all networks are untrusted.\nIf the encryption setting changes but the name and MAC address remain the\n   same, NetworkManager attempts to connect, but first you are asked to confirm the new\n   encryption settings and provide any updates, such as a new key.\nIf you switch from using a wireless connection to offline mode,\n   NetworkManager blanks the SSID or ESSID. This ensures that the card is\n   disconnected.\n31.4.1\nUser and system connections\n#\nNetworkManager knows two types of connections:\nuser\nand\nsystem\nconnections.\nUser connections require every user to authenticate in NetworkManager, which stores\n    the user's credentials in their local GNOME keyring so that they do not\n    need to re-enter them every time they connect.\nSystem connections are available to all users automatically. The first user\n    to create the connection enters any necessary credentials, and then all other\n    users have access without needing to know the credentials. The difference in\n    configuring a user or system connection is a single check box,\nMake\n    available to other users\n.\n    For information on how to configure user or system connections with NetworkManager, refer\n    to\nSection 31.3, “Configuring network connections”\n.\n31.4.2\nStoring passwords and credentials\n#\nIf you do not want to re-enter your credentials each time you want to\n    connect to an encrypted network, you can use the GNOME Keyring Manager to\n    store your credentials encrypted on the disk, secured by a master password.\n31.4.3\nFirewall zones\n#\nFigure 31.2:\nfirewalld\nzones in NetworkManager\n#\nThe firewall zones set general rules about which network\n    connections are allowed. To configure the zone of\nfirewalld\nfor a wired connection, go to the\nIdentity\ntab of the connection settings. To\n    configure the zone of\nfirewalld\nfor a Wi-Fi\n    connection, go to the\nSecurity\ntab of the\n    connection settings.\nIf you are in your home network, use the zone\nhome\n. For public wireless networks, switch to\npublic\n. If you are in a secure environment and\n    want to allow all connections, use the zone\ntrusted\n.\nFor details about firewalld, see\nSection 23.4, “\nfirewalld\n”\n.\n31.5\nFrequently asked questions\n#\nIn the following, find some frequently asked questions about configuring\n   special network options with NetworkManager.\n5.\nHow to tie a connection to a specific device?\nBy default, connections in NetworkManager are device type-specific: they apply to\n      all physical devices with the same type. If more than one physical device\n      per connection type is available (for example, your machine is equipped\n      with two Ethernet cards), you can tie a connection to a certain device.\nTo do this in GNOME, first look up the MAC address of your device (use\n      the\nConnection Information\navailable from the applet,\n      or use the output of command line tools like\nnm-tool\nor\nwicked show all\n). Then start the dialog for\n      configuring network connections and choose the connection you want to\n      modify. On the\nWired\nor\nWireless\ntab, enter the\nMAC Address\nof the device and confirm\n      your changes.\n6.\nHow to specify a certain access point in case multiple access points with\n      the same ESSID are detected?\nWhen multiple access points with different wireless bands (a/b/g/n) are\n      available, the access point with the strongest signal is automatically\n      chosen by default. To override this, use the\nBSSID\nfield when configuring wireless connections.\nThe Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID) uniquely identifies each Basic\n      Service Set. In an infrastructure Basic Service Set, the BSSID is the MAC\n      address of the wireless access point. In an independent (ad-hoc) Basic\n      Service Set, the BSSID is a locally administered MAC address generated\n      from a 46-bit random number.\nStart the dialog for configuring network connections as described in\nSection 31.3, “Configuring network connections”\n. Choose the wireless connection you\n      want to modify and click\nEdit\n. On the\nWireless\ntab, enter the BSSID.\n7.\nHow to share network connections with other computers?\nThe primary device (the device which is connected to the Internet) does\n      not need any special configuration. However, you need to configure the\n      device that is connected to the local hub or machine as follows:\nStart the dialog for configuring network connections as described in\nSection 31.3, “Configuring network connections”\n. Choose the connection you want to\n        modify and click\nEdit\n. Switch to the\nIPv4\n        Settings\ntab and from the\nMethod\ndrop-down\n        box, activate\nShared to other computers\n. That will\n        enable IP traffic forwarding and run a DHCP server on the device.\n        Confirm your changes in NetworkManager.\nAs the DCHP server uses port\n67\n, make sure that it\n        is not blocked by the firewall: On the machine sharing the connections,\n        start YaST and select\nSecurity and\n        Users\n›\nFirewall\n. Switch to\n        the\nAllowed Services\ncategory. If\nDCHP\n        Server\nis not already shown as\nAllowed\n        Service\n, select\nDCHP Server\nfrom\nServices to Allow\nand click\nAdd\n.\n        Confirm your changes in YaST.\n8.\nHow to provide static DNS information with automatic (DHCP, PPP, VPN)\n      addresses?\nIn case a DHCP server provides invalid DNS information (and/or routes),\n      you can override it. Start the dialog for configuring network connections\n      as described in\nSection 31.3, “Configuring network connections”\n. Choose the connection\n      you want to modify and click\nEdit\n. Switch to the\nIPv4 Settings\ntab, and from the\nMethod\ndrop-down box, activate\nAutomatic\n      (DHCP) addresses only\n. Enter the DNS information in the\nDNS Servers\nand\nSearch Domains\nfields. To\nIgnore automatically obtained routes\nclick\nRoutes\nand activate the respective check box. Confirm\n      your changes.\n9.\nHow to make NetworkManager connect to password protected networks before a user\n      logs in?\nDefine a\nsystem connection\nthat can be used for such\n      purposes. For more information, refer to\nSection 31.4.1, “User and system connections”\n.\n31.6\nTroubleshooting\n#\nConnection problems can occur. Some common problems related to NetworkManager include\n   the applet not starting or a missing VPN option. Methods for resolving and\n   preventing these problems depend on the tool used.\nNetworkManager desktop applet does not start\nThe applets starts automatically if the network is set up for NetworkManager\n      control. If the applet does not start, check if NetworkManager is enabled in YaST\n      as described in\nSection 31.2, “Enabling or disabling NetworkManager”\n. Then make sure that\n      the NetworkManager-gnome package is also installed.\nIf the desktop applet is installed but is not running for some reason,\n      start it manually with the command\nnm-applet\n.\nNetworkManager applet does not include the VPN option\nSupport for NetworkManager, applets, and VPN for NetworkManager is distributed in separate\n      packages. If your NetworkManager applet does not include the VPN option, check if\n      the packages with NetworkManager support for your VPN technology are installed. For\n      more information, see\nSection 31.3.4, “NetworkManager and VPN”\n.\nNo network connection available\nIf you have configured your network connection correctly and all other\n      components for the network connection (router, etc.) are also up and\n      running, it sometimes helps to restart the network interfaces on your\n      computer. To do so, log in to a command line as\nroot\nand run\nsystemctl restart wickeds\n.\n31.7\nMore information\n#\nMore information about NetworkManager can be found on the following Web sites and\n   directories:\nNetworkManager project page\nhttps://gitlab.freedesktop.org/NetworkManager/NetworkManager\nPackage documentation\nAlso check out the information in the following directories for the\n      latest information about NetworkManager and the GNOME applet:\n/usr/share/doc/packages/NetworkManager/\n,\n/usr/share/doc/packages/NetworkManager-gnome/\n.\nOn this page\n31.1\nUse cases for NetworkManager\n31.2\nEnabling or disabling NetworkManager\n31.3\nConfiguring network connections\n31.4\nNetworkManager and security\n31.5\nFrequently asked questions\n31.6\nTroubleshooting\n31.7\nMore information\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

To change the default settings, or to\n  set up a sound card that could not be configured automatically, use the\n  YaST sound module. There, you can also set up additional sound cards or\n  switch their order.\nWarning\nIf you do not know all details about the setup of your sound system, do not\n    change its settings manually. Instead, let your sound\n    subsystem—PipeWire or PulseAudio— configure it for you. Use\n    dedicated desktop application to switch audio devices. As a fallback, use\n    the\npavucontrol\ngraphical application.\nTo start the sound module, start YaST and click\nHardware\n›\nSound\n.\n  Alternatively, start the\nSound Configuration\ndialog\n  directly by running\nyast2 sound &\nas user\nroot\nfrom a command line. If the sound module is not available, install it using\n  the\nsudo zypper install yast2-sound\ncommand.\nProcedure 33.1:\nConfiguring sound cards\n#\nIf you have added a new sound card or YaST could not automatically\n   configure an existing sound card, follow the steps below. For configuring a\n   new sound card, you need to know your sound card vendor and model. If in\n   doubt, refer to your sound card documentation for the required information.\n   For a reference list of sound cards supported by ALSA with their\n   corresponding sound modules, see\nhttp://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Matrix:Main\n.\nDuring configuration, you can choose between the following setup options:\nQuick automatic setup\nYou are not required to go through any of the further configuration\n      steps—the sound card is configured automatically. You can set the\n      volume or any options you want to change later.\nNormal setup\nAllows you to adjust the output volume and play a test sound during the\n      configuration.\nAdvanced setup with possibility to change options\nFor experts only. Allows you to customize all parameters of the sound\n      card.\nImportant: Advanced configuration\nOnly use this option if you know exactly what you are doing. Otherwise\n       leave the parameters untouched and use the normal or the automatic setup\n       options.\nStart the YaST sound module.\nTo configure a detected, but\nNot Configured\nsound card,\n    select the respective entry from the list and click\nEdit\n.\nTo configure a new sound card, click\nAdd\n. Select your\n    sound card vendor and model and click\nNext\n.\nChoose one of the setup options and click\nNext\n.\nIf you have chosen\nNormal Setup\n, you can now\nTest\nyour sound configuration and make adjustments to\n    the volume. You should start at about ten percent volume to avoid damage to\n    your hearing or the speakers.\nIf all options are set according to your wishes, click\nNext\n.\nThe\nSound Configuration\ndialog shows the newly\n    configured or modified sound card.\nTo remove a sound card configuration that you no longer need, select the\n    respective entry and click\nDelete\n.\nClick\nOK\nto save the changes and leave the YaST sound\n    module.\nProcedure 33.2:\nModifying sound card configurations\n#\nTo change the configuration of an individual sound card (for experts\n    only!), select the sound card entry in the\nSound\n    Configuration\ndialog and click\nEdit\n.\nThis takes you to the\nSound Card Advanced Options\nwhere\n    you can fine-tune several parameters. For more information, click\nHelp\n.\nTo adjust the volume of an already configured sound card or to test the\n    sound card, select the sound card entry in the\nSound\n    Configuration\ndialog and click\nOther\n. Select\n    the respective menu item.\nNote: YaST mixer\nThe YaST mixer settings provide only basic options. They are intended\n     for troubleshooting (for example, if the test sound is not audible).\n     Access the YaST mixer settings from\nOther\n›\nVolume\n. For\n     everyday use and fine-tuning of sound options, use the mixer applet\n     provided by your desktop or the\nalsasound\ncommand line\n     tool.\nFor playback of MIDI files, select\nOther\n›\nStart Sequencer\n.\nWhen a supported sound card is detected, you can install SoundFonts for\n    playback of MIDI files:\nInsert the original driver CD-ROM into your CD or DVD drive.\nSelect\nOther\n›\nInstall\n      SoundFonts\nto copy SF2 SoundFonts™ to your\n      hard disk. The SoundFonts are saved in the directory\n/usr/share/sfbank/creative/\n.\nIf you have configured more than one sound card in your system you can\n    adjust the order of your sound cards. To set a sound card as primary\n    device, select the sound card in the\nSound Configuration\nand click\nOther\n›\nSet as the Primary\n    Card\n. The sound device with index\n0\nis the default device and thus used by the system and\n    the applications.\nBy default,\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nuses the PulseAudio sound system. This is an\n    abstraction layer that helps to mix multiple audio streams, bypassing any\n    restrictions the hardware may have. To enable or disable the PulseAudio\n    sound system, click\nOther\n›\nPulseAudio Configuration\n. If enabled,\n    PulseAudio daemon is used to play sounds. Disable\nPulseAudio\n    Support\nto use something else system-wide.\nThe volume and configuration of all sound cards are saved when you click\nOK\nand leave the YaST sound module. The mixer settings\n  are saved to the file\n/etc/asound.state\n. The ALSA\n  configuration data is appended to the end of the file\n/etc/modprobe.d/sound\nand written to\n/etc/sysconfig/sound\n.\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

It is also\n  possible to share printers over the network. Further information about\n  printing (general information, technical details, and troubleshooting) is\n  available in\nChapter 24,\nPrinter operation\n.\nIn YaST, click\nHardware\n›\nPrinter\nto start the printer module. By\n  default it opens in the\nPrinter Configurations\nview,\n  displaying a list of all printers that are available and configured. This is\n  especially useful when having access to a lot of printers via the network.\n  From here you can also\nPrint a Test Page\nand configure\n  printers.\nNote: Starting CUPS\nTo print from your system, CUPS must be running. In case it is not\n   running, you are asked to start it. Answer with\nYes\n, or\n   you cannot configure printing. In case CUPS is not started at boot time, you\n   will also be asked to enable this feature. It is recommended to say\nYes\n, otherwise CUPS would need to be started manually\n   after each reboot.\n34.1\nConfiguring printers\n#\nUsually a USB printer is automatically detected. There are two possible\n   reasons it is not automatically detected:\nThe USB printer is switched off.\nCommunication between printer and computer is not possible. Check the\n     cable and the plugs to make sure that the printer is properly connected.\n     If this is the case, the problem may not be printer-related, but rather a\n     USB-related problem.\nConfiguring a printer is a three-step process: specify the connection type,\n   choose a driver, and name the print queue for this setup.\nFor many printer models, several drivers are available. When configuring the\n   printer, YaST defaults to those marked\nrecommended\nas a\n   general rule. Normally it is not necessary to change the driver. However, if\n   you want a color printer to print only in black and white, you can use a driver that does not support color printing. If you experience performance problems with a PostScript printer\n   when printing graphics, try to switch from a PostScript driver to a\n   PCL driver (provided your printer understands PCL).\nIf no driver for your printer is listed, try to select a generic driver with\n   an appropriate standard language from the list. Refer to your printer's\n   documentation to find out which language (the set of commands controlling\n   the printer) your printer understands. If this does not work, refer to\nSection 34.1.1, “Adding drivers with YaST”\nfor another possible\n   solution.\nA printer is never used directly, but always through a print queue. This\n   ensures that simultaneous jobs can be queued and processed one after the\n   other. Each print queue is assigned to a specific driver, and a printer can\n   have multiple queues. This makes it possible to set up a second queue on a\n   color printer that prints black and white only, for example. Refer to\nSection 24.1, “The CUPS workflow”\nfor more information about print queues.\nProcedure 34.1:\nAdding a new printer\n#\nStart the YaST printer module with\nHardware\n›\nPrinter\n.\nIn the\nPrinter Configurations\nscreen click\nAdd\n.\nIf your printer is already listed under\nSpecify the\n     Connection\n, proceed with the next step. Otherwise, try to\nDetect More\nor start the\nConnection\n     Wizard\n.\nIn the text box under\nFind and Assign a Driver\nenter\n     the vendor name and the model name and click\nSearch\n     for\n.\nChoose a driver that matches your printer. It is recommended to choose the\n     driver listed first. If no suitable driver is displayed:\nCheck your search term.\nBroaden your search by clicking\nFind More\n.\nAdd a driver as described in\nSection 34.1.1, “Adding drivers with YaST”\n.\nSpecify the\nDefault paper size\n.\nIn the\nSet Arbitrary Name\nfield, enter a unique name\n     for the print queue.\nThe printer is now configured with the default settings and ready to use.\n     Click\nOK\nto return to the\nPrinter\n     Configurations\nview. The newly configured printer is now visible\n     in the list of printers.\n34.1.1\nAdding drivers with YaST\n#\nNot all printer drivers available for\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nare installed by\n    default. If no suitable driver is available in the\nFind and Assign\n    a Driver\ndialog when adding a new printer install a driver\n    package containing drivers for your printers:\nProcedure 34.2:\nInstalling additional driver packages\n#\nStart the YaST printer module with\nHardware\n›\nPrinter\n.\nIn the\nPrinter Configurations\nscreen, click\nAdd\n.\nIn the\nFind and Assign a Driver\nsection, click\nDriver Packages\n.\nChoose one or more suitable driver packages from the list. Do\nnot\nspecify the path to a printer description file.\nChoose\nOK\nand confirm the package installation.\nTo directly use these drivers, proceed as described in\nProcedure 34.1, “Adding a new printer”\n.\nPostScript printers do not need printer driver software. PostScript\n    printers need only a PostScript Printer Description (PPD) file which\n    matches the particular model. PPD files are provided by the printer\n    manufacturer.\nIf no suitable PPD file is available in the\nFind and Assign a\n    Driver\ndialog when adding a PostScript printer, install a PPD file\n    for your printer:\nSeveral sources for PPD files are available. It is recommended to first try\n    additional driver packages that are shipped with\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nbut not\n    installed by default (see below for installation instructions). If these\n    packages do not contain suitable drivers for your printer, get PPD files\n    directly from your printer vendor or from the driver CD of a PostScript\n    printer. For details, see\nSection 24.8.2, “No suitable PPD file available for a PostScript printer”\n.\n    Alternatively, find PPD files at\nhttps://www.openprinting.org/printers\n,\n    the\n“\nOpenPrinting.org printer database\n”\n. When using PPD files\n    from OpenPrinting, keep in mind that they may not be supported by\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n.\nProcedure 34.3:\nAdding a PPD file for PostScript printers\n#\nStart the YaST printer module with\nHardware\n›\nPrinter\n.\nIn the\nPrinter Configurations\nscreen, click\nAdd\n.\nIn the\nFind and Assign a Driver\nsection, click\nDriver Packages\n.\nEnter the full path to the PPD file into the text box under\nMake\n      a Printer Description File Available\n.\nClick\nOK\nto return to the\nAdd New Printer\n      Configuration\nscreen.\nTo directly use this PPD file, proceed as described in\nProcedure 34.1, “Adding a new printer”\n.\n34.1.2\nEditing a local printer configuration\n#\nBy editing an existing configuration for a printer you can change basic\n    settings such as connection type and driver. It is also possible to adjust\n    the default settings for paper size, resolution, media source, etc. You can\n    change identifiers of the printer by altering the printer description or\n    location.\nStart the YaST printer module with\nHardware\n›\nPrinter\n.\nIn the\nPrinter Configurations\nscreen, choose a local\n      printer configuration from the list and click\nEdit\n.\nChange the connection type or the driver as described in\nProcedure 34.1, “Adding a new printer”\n. This should only be\n      necessary in case you have problems with the current configuration.\nOptionally, make this printer the default by checking\nDefault\n      Printer\n.\nAdjust the default settings by clicking\nAll Options for the\n      Current Driver\n. To change a setting, expand the list of options\n      by clicking the relative\n+\nsign. Change the default by\n      clicking an option. Apply your changes with\nOK\n.\n34.2\nConfiguring printing via the network with YaST\n#\nNetwork printers are not detected automatically. They must be configured\n   manually using the YaST printer module. Depending on your network setup,\n   you can print to a print server (CUPS, LPD, SMB, or IPX) or directly to a\n   network printer (preferably via TCP). Access the configuration view for\n   network printing by choosing\nPrinting via Network\nfrom\n   the left pane in the YaST printer module.\n34.2.1\nUsing CUPS\n#\nIn a Linux environment CUPS is usually used to print via the network. The\n    simplest setup is to only print via a single CUPS server which can directly\n    be accessed by all clients. Printing via more than one CUPS server requires\n    a running local CUPS daemon that communicates with the remote CUPS servers.\nImportant: Browsing network print queues\nCUPS servers announce their print queues over the network either via the\n     traditional CUPS browsing protocol or via Bonjour/DNS-SD. Clients need\n     to browse these lists so users can select specific printers to\n     send their print jobs to. To browse network print queues, the\n     service\ncups-browsed\nprovided by\n     the package\ncups-filters-cups-browsed\nmust run on all clients that print via CUPS\n     servers.\ncups-browsed\nis started\n     automatically when configuring network printing with YaST.\nIn case browsing does not work after having started\ncups-browsed\n, the CUPS server(s)\n     probably announce the network print queues via Bonjour/DNS-SD. In this\n     case you need to additionally install the package\navahi\nand start the associated\n     service with\nsudo systemctl start avahi-daemon\non all\n     clients.\nProcedure 34.4:\nPrinting via a single CUPS server\n#\nStart the YaST printer module with\nHardware\n›\nPrinter\n.\nFrom the left pane, launch the\nPrint via Network\nscreen.\nCheck\nDo All Your Printing Directly via One Single CUPS\n      Server\nand specify the name or IP address of the server.\nClick\nTest Server\nto make sure you have chosen the\n      correct name or IP address.\nClick\nOK\nto return to the\nPrinter Configurations\nscreen. All printers available via the CUPS server are now listed.\nProcedure 34.5:\nPrinting via multiple CUPS servers\n#\nStart the YaST printer module with\nHardware\n›\nPrinter\n.\nFrom the left pane, launch the\nPrint via Network\nscreen.\nCheck\nAccept Printer Announcements from CUPS Servers\n.\nUnder\nGeneral Settings\nspecify which servers to use.\n      You may accept connections from all networks available or from specific\n      hosts. If you choose the latter option, you need to specify the host\n      names or IP addresses.\nConfirm by clicking\nOK\nand then\nYes\nwhen asked to start a local CUPS server. After the server has started\n      YaST will return to the\nPrinter Configurations\nscreen. Click\nRefresh list\nto see the printers\n      detected so far. Click this button again, in case more printers are\n      available.\n34.2.2\nUsing print servers other than CUPS\n#\nIf your network offers print services via print servers other than CUPS,\n    start the YaST printer module with\nHardware\n›\nPrinter\nand\n    launch the\nPrint via Network\nscreen from the left pane.\n    Start the\nConnection Wizard\nand choose the appropriate\nConnection Type\n. Ask your network administrator for\n    details on configuring a network printer in your environment.\n34.3\nSharing printers over the network\n#\nPrinters managed by a local CUPS daemon can be shared over the network and\n   so turn your machine into a CUPS server. Usually you share a printer by\n   enabling so-called\n“\nbrowsing mode\n”\nin CUPS. If browsing is\n   enabled, the local print queues are made available on the network for\n   listening to remote CUPS daemons. It is also possible to set up a dedicated\n   CUPS server that manages all print queues and can directly be accessed by\n   remote clients. In this case it is not necessary to enable browsing.\nProcedure 34.6:\nSharing printers\n#\nStart the YaST printer module with\nHardware\n›\nPrinter\n.\nLaunch the\nShare Printers\nscreen from the left pane.\nSelect\nAllow Remote Access\n. Also check\nFor\n     computers within the local network\nand enable browsing mode by\n     also checking\nPublish printers by default within the local\n     network\n.\nClick\nOK\nto restart the CUPS server and to return to\n     the\nPrinter Configurations\nscreen.\nRegarding CUPS and firewall settings, see\nhttps://en.opensuse.org/SDB:CUPS_and_SANE_Firewall_settings\n.\nOn this page\n34.1\nConfiguring printers\n34.2\nConfiguring printing via the network with YaST\n34.3\nSharing printers over the network\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) is\n  available on all modern computers (laptops, desktops, and servers). Power\n  management technologies require suitable hardware and BIOS routines. Most\n  laptops and many modern desktops and servers meet these requirements. It is\n  also possible to control CPU frequency scaling to save power or decrease\n  noise.\n35.1\nPower saving functions\n#\nPower saving functions are not only significant for the mobile use of\n   laptops, but also for desktop systems. The main functions and their use in\n   ACPI are:\nStandby\nNot supported.\nSuspend (to memory)\nThis mode writes the entire system state to the RAM. Subsequently, the\n      entire system except the RAM is put to sleep. In this state, the computer\n      consumes very little power. The advantage of this state is the\n      possibility of resuming work at the same point within a few seconds\n      without having to boot and restart applications. This function\n      corresponds to the ACPI state\nS3\n.\nHibernation (suspend to disk)\nIn this operating mode, the entire system state is written to the hard\n      disk and the system is powered off. There must be a swap partition at\n      least as big as the RAM to write all the active data. Reactivation from\n      this state takes about 30 to 90 seconds. The state prior to the suspend\n      is restored. Some manufacturers offer useful hybrid variants of this\n      mode, such as RediSafe in IBM Thinkpads. The corresponding ACPI state is\nS4\n. In Linux, suspend to disk is performed by kernel\n      routines that are independent from ACPI.\nNote: Changed UUID for swap partitions when formatting via\nmkswap\nDo not reformat existing swap partitions with\nmkswap\nif possible. Reformatting with\nmkswap\nwill change\n     the UUID value of the swap partition. Either reformat via YaST (which\n     will update\n/etc/fstab\n) or adjust\n/etc/fstab\nmanually.\nBattery monitor\nACPI checks the battery charge status and provides information about it.\n      Additionally, it coordinates actions to perform when a critical charge\n      status is reached.\nAutomatic power-off\nFollowing a shutdown, the computer is powered off. This is especially\n      important when an automatic shutdown is performed shortly before the\n      battery is empty.\nProcessor speed control\nIn connection with the CPU, energy can be saved in three different ways:\n      frequency and voltage scaling (also known as\nPowerNow!\nor\nSpeedstep\n), throttling and putting\n      the processor to sleep (C-states). Depending on the operating mode of the\n      computer, these methods can also be combined.\n35.2\nAdvanced configuration and power interface (ACPI)\n#\nACPI was designed to enable the operating system to set up and control the\n   individual hardware components. ACPI supersedes both Power Management Plug\n   and Play (PnP) and Advanced Power Management (APM). It delivers information\n   about the battery, AC adapter, temperature, fan and system events, like\n“\nclose lid\n”\nor\n“\nbattery low.\n”\nThe BIOS provides tables containing information about the individual\n   components and hardware access methods. The operating system uses this\n   information for tasks like assigning interrupts or activating and\n   deactivating components. Because the operating system executes commands\n   stored into the BIOS, the functionality depends on the BIOS implementation.\n   The tables ACPI can detect and load are reported in journald. See\nChapter 21,\njournalctl\n: Query the\nsystemd\njournal\nfor more information on viewing the journal\n   log messages. See\nSection 35.2.2, “Troubleshooting”\nfor more information\n   about troubleshooting ACPI problems.\n35.2.1\nControlling the CPU performance\n#\nThe CPU can save energy in three ways:\nFrequency and Voltage Scaling\nThrottling the Clock Frequency (T-states)\nPutting the Processor to Sleep (C-states)\nDepending on the operating mode of the computer, these methods can be\n    combined. Saving energy also means that the system heats up less and the\n    fans are activated less frequently.\nFrequency scaling and throttling are only relevant if the processor is\n    busy, because the most economic C-state is applied anyway when the\n    processor is idle. If the CPU is busy, frequency scaling is the recommended\n    power saving method. Often the processor only works with a partial load. In\n    this case, it can be run with a lower frequency. Usually, dynamic frequency\n    scaling controlled by the kernel on-demand governor is the best approach.\nThrottling should be used as the last resort, for example, to extend the\n    battery operation time despite a high system load. However, some systems do\n    not run smoothly when they are throttled too much. Moreover, CPU throttling\n    does not make sense if the CPU has little to do.\nFor in-depth information, refer to\nChapter 12,\nPower management\n.\n35.2.2\nTroubleshooting\n#\nThere are two different types of problems. On one hand, the ACPI code of\n    the kernel may contain bugs that were not detected in time. In this case, a\n    solution will be made available for download. More often, the problems are\n    caused by the BIOS. Sometimes, deviations from the ACPI specification are\n    purposely integrated in the BIOS to circumvent errors in the ACPI\n    implementation of other widespread operating systems. Hardware components\n    that have serious errors in the ACPI implementation are recorded in a\n    blacklist that prevents the Linux kernel from using ACPI for these\n    components.\nThe first thing to do when problems are encountered is to update the BIOS.\n    If the computer does not boot, one of the following boot parameters may be\n    helpful:\npci=noacpi\nDo not use ACPI for configuring the PCI devices.\nacpi=ht\nOnly perform a simple resource configuration. Do not use ACPI for other\n       purposes.\nacpi=off\nDisable ACPI.\nWarning: Problems booting without ACPI\nSome newer machines (especially SMP systems and AMD64 systems) need ACPI\n     for configuring the hardware correctly. On these machines, disabling ACPI\n     can cause problems.\nSometimes, the machine is confused by hardware that is attached over USB or\n    FireWire. If a machine refuses to boot, unplug all unneeded hardware and\n    try again.\nMonitor the boot messages of the system with the command\ndmesg\n    -T\n| grep -2i acpi\n(or all messages, because the\n    problem may not be caused by ACPI) after booting. If an error occurs while\n    parsing an ACPI table, the most important table—the DSDT\n    (\nDifferentiated System Description Table\n)—can be\n    replaced with an improved version. In this case, the faulty DSDT of the\n    BIOS is ignored. The procedure is described in\nSection 35.4, “Troubleshooting”\n.\nIn the kernel configuration, there is a switch for activating ACPI debug\n    messages. If a kernel with ACPI debugging is compiled and installed,\n    detailed information is issued.\nIf you experience BIOS or hardware problems, it is always advisable to\n    contact the manufacturers. Especially if they do not always provide\n    assistance for Linux, they should be confronted with the problems.\n    Manufacturers will only take the issue seriously if they realize that an\n    adequate number of their customers use Linux.\n35.2.2.1\nMore information\n#\nhttps://tldp.org/HOWTO/ACPI-HOWTO/\n(detailed ACPI\n       HOWTO, contains DSDT patches)\nhttps://uefi.org/specifications\n(Advanced Configuration &\n       Power Interface Specification)\n35.3\nRest for the hard disk\n#\nIn Linux, the hard disk can be put to sleep entirely if it is not needed or\n   it can be run in a more economic or quieter mode. On modern laptops, you do\n   not need to switch off the hard disks manually, because they automatically\n   enter an economic operating mode whenever they are not needed. However, if\n   you want to maximize power savings, test some of the following methods,\n   using the\nhdparm\ncommand.\nIt can be used to modify various hard disk settings. The option\n-y\ninstantly switches the hard disk to the standby mode.\n-Y\nputs it to sleep.\nhdparm\n-S\nX\ncauses the hard disk to be\n   spun down after a certain period of inactivity. Replace\nX\nas follows:\n0\ndisables this\n   mechanism, causing the hard disk to run continuously. Values from\n1\nto\n240\nare multiplied by 5\n   seconds. Values from\n241\nto\n251\ncorrespond to 1 to 11 times 30 minutes.\nInternal power saving options of the hard disk can be controlled with the\n   option\n-B\n. Select a value from\n0\nto\n255\nfor maximum saving to maximum throughput. The result\n   depends on the hard disk used and is difficult to assess. To make a hard\n   disk quieter, use the option\n-M\n. Select a value from\n128\nto\n254\nfor quiet to fast.\nOften, it is not so easy to put the hard disk to sleep. In Linux, numerous\n   processes write to the hard disk, waking it up repeatedly. Therefore, it is\n   important to understand how Linux handles data that needs to be written to\n   the hard disk. First, all data is buffered in the RAM. This buffer is\n   monitored by the\npdflush\ndaemon.\n   When the data reaches a certain age limit or when the buffer is filled to a\n   certain degree, the buffer content is flushed to the hard disk. The buffer\n   size is dynamic and depends on the size of the memory and the system load.\n   By default, pdflush is set to short intervals to achieve maximum data\n   integrity. It checks the buffer every 5 seconds and writes the data to the\n   hard disk. The following variables are interesting:\n/proc/sys/vm/dirty_writeback_centisecs\nContains the delay until a pdflush thread wakes up (in hundredths of a\n      second).\n/proc/sys/vm/dirty_expire_centisecs\nDefines after which timeframe a dirty page should be written at latest.\n      Default is\n3000\n, which means 30 seconds.\n/proc/sys/vm/dirty_background_ratio\nMaximum percentage of dirty pages until pdflush begins to write them.\n      Default is\n5\n%.\n/proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio\nWhen the dirty pages exceed this percentage of the total memory,\n      processes are forced to write dirty buffers during their time slice\n      instead of continuing to write.\nWarning: Data integrity risk\nChanges to the\npdflush\ndaemon\n    settings can compromise data integrity.\nApart from these processes, journaling file systems, like\nBtrfs\n,\nExt3\n,\nExt4\nand others write their\n   metadata independently from\npdflush\n,\n   which also prevents the hard disk from spinning down.\nAnother important factor is the way active programs behave. For example,\n   good editors regularly write hidden backups of the currently modified file\n   to the hard disk, causing the disk to wake up. Features like this can be\n   disabled at the expense of data integrity.\nIn this connection, the mail daemon postfix uses the variable\nPOSTFIX_LAPTOP\n. If this variable is set to\nyes\n, postfix accesses the hard disk far less frequently.\n35.4\nTroubleshooting\n#\nAll error messages and alerts are logged in the system journal, which can be\n   queried with the command\njournalctl\n(see\nChapter 21,\njournalctl\n: Query the\nsystemd\njournal\nfor more information). The following\n   sections cover the most common problems.\n35.4.1\nCPU frequency does not work\n#\nRefer to the kernel sources to see if your processor is supported. You may\n    need a special kernel module or module option to activate CPU frequency\n    control. If the\nkernel-source\npackage is installed, this information is available in\n/usr/src/linux/Documentation/cpu-freq/*\n.\nOn this page\n35.1\nPower saving functions\n35.2\nAdvanced configuration and power interface (ACPI)\n35.3\nRest for the hard disk\n35.4\nTroubleshooting\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

As such, it is supplied in the same physical form\n   factor as RAM—as DIMMs. These are known as NVDIMMs: non-volatile dual\n   inline memory modules.\nUnlike RAM, though, persistent memory is also similar to flash-based SSDs in\n   several ways. Both are based on forms of solid-state memory circuitry, but \n   despite this, both provide non-volatile storage: Their contents are retained\n   when the system is powered off or restarted. For both forms of medium,\n   writing data is slower than reading it, and both support a limited number of\n   rewrite cycles. Finally, also like SSDs, sector-level access to persistent\n   memory is possible if that is more suitable for a particular application.\nDifferent models use different forms of electronic storage medium, such as\n   Intel 3D XPoint, or a combination of NAND-flash and DRAM. New forms of\n   non-volatile RAM are also in development. This means that different vendors\n   and models of NVDIMM offer different performance and durability\n   characteristics.\nBecause the storage technologies involved are in an early stage of\n   development, different vendors' hardware may impose different limitations.\n   Thus, the following statements are generalizations.\nPersistent memory is up to ten times slower than DRAM, but around a thousand\n   times faster than flash storage. It can be rewritten on a byte-by-byte basis\n   rather than flash memory's whole-sector erase-and-rewrite process. Finally, \n   while rewrite cycles are limited, most forms of persistent memory can handle\n   millions of rewrites, compared to the thousands of cycles of flash storage.\nThis has two important consequences:\nIt is not possible with current technology to run a system with only\n     persistent memory and thus achieve completely non-volatile main memory. You\n     must use a mixture of both conventional RAM and NVDIMMs. The operating\n     system and applications will execute in conventional RAM, with the NVDIMMs\n     providing very fast supplementary storage.\nThe performance characteristics of different vendors' persistent memory\n     mean that it may be necessary for programmers to be aware of the hardware\n     specifications of the NVDIMMs in a particular server, including how many\n     NVDIMMs there are and in which memory slots they are fitted. This will\n     impact hypervisor use, migration of software between different\n     host machines, and so on.\nThis new storage subsystem is defined in version 6 of the ACPI standard.\n   However,\nlibnvdimm\nsupports pre-standard NVDIMMs and\n   they can be used in the same way.\nTip: Intel Optane DC Persistent Memory\nIntel Optane DIMMs memory can be used in specific modes:\nIn\nApp Direct Mode\n, the Intel Optane memory is used as\n      fast persistent storage, an alternative to SSDs and NVMe devices. Data in\n      this mode is kept when the system is powered off.\nApp Direct Mode has been supported since SLE 12 SP4.\nIn\nMemory Mode\n, the Intel Optane memory serves as a\n      cost-effective, high-capacity alternative to DRAM. In this mode, separate\n      DRAM DIMMs act as a cache for the most frequently accessed data while the\n      Optane DIMMs memory provides large memory capacity. However, compared with\n      DRAM-only systems, this mode is slower under random access workloads. If\n      you run applications without Optane-specific enhancements that take\n      advantage of this mode, memory performance may decrease. Data in this\n      mode is lost when the system is powered off.\nMemory Mode has been supported since SLE 15 SP1.\nIn\nMixed Mode\n, the Intel Optane memory is\n      partitioned, so it can serve in both modes simultaneously.\nMixed Mode has been supported since SLE 15 SP1.\nFor more detailed information about Intel Optane DC persistent memory,\n    refer to\nhttps://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/memory-and-storage/data-center-persistent-mem/Intel-Optane-DC-Persistent-Memory-Quick-Start-Guide.pdf\n.\n36.2\nTerms\n#\nRegion\nA\nregion\nis a block of persistent memory that can\n      be divided up into one or more\nnamespace\ns. You\n      cannot access the persistent memory of a region without first allocating\n      it to a namespace.\nNamespace\nA single contiguously-addressed range of non-volatile storage, comparable\n      to NVM Express SSD namespaces, or to SCSI Logical Units (LUNs). Namespaces\n      appear in the server's\n/dev\ndirectory as separate\n      block devices. Depending on the method of access required, namespaces can\n      either amalgamate storage from multiple NVDIMMs into larger volumes, or\n      allow it to be partitioned into smaller volumes.\nMode\nEach namespace also has a\nmode\nthat defines which\n      NVDIMM features are enabled for that namespace. Sibling namespaces of the\n      same parent region will always have the same type, but might be\n      configured to have different modes. Namespace modes include:\ndevdax\nDevice-DAX mode. Creates a single-character device file (\n/dev/dax\nX\n.\nY\n). Does\nnot\nrequire file system\n         creation.\nfsdax\nFile system-DAX mode. Default if no other mode is specified. Creates a\n         block device (\n/dev/pmem\nX\n[.\nY\n]\n) which supports DAX for\next4\nor\nXFS\n.\nsector\nFor legacy file systems which do not checksum metadata. Suitable for\n         small boot volumes. Compatible with other operating systems.\nraw\nA memory disk without a label or metadata. Does not support DAX.\n         Compatible with other operating systems.\nNote\nraw\nmode is not supported by SUSE. It is not\n          possible to mount file systems on\nraw\nnamespaces.\nType\nEach namespace and region has a\ntype\nthat defines\n      the way in which the persistent memory associated with that namespace or\n      region can be accessed. A namespace always has the same type as its\n      parent region. There are two different types: Persistent Memory, which\n      can be configured in two different ways, and the deprecated Block Mode.\nPersistent memory (PMEM)\nPMEM storage offers byte-level access, similar to RAM. Using PMEM, a\n         single namespace can include multiple interleaved NVDIMMs, allowing\n         them all to be used as a single device.\nThere are two ways to configure a PMEM namespace.\nPMEM with DAX\nA PMEM namespace configured for Direct Access (DAX) means that\n            accessing the memory bypasses the kernel's page cache and goes\n            direct to the medium. Software can directly read or write every\n            byte of the namespace separately.\nPMEM with block translation table (BTT)\nA PMEM namespace configured to operate in BTT mode is accessed on a\n            sector-by-sector basis, like a conventional disk drive, rather than\n            the more RAM-like byte-addressable model. A translation table\n            mechanism batches accesses into sector-sized units.\nThe advantage of BTT is data protection. The storage subsystem\n            ensures that each sector is completely written to the underlying\n            medium. If a sector cannot be completely written (that is, if the\n            write operation fails for some reason), then the whole sector will\n            be rolled back to its previous state. Thus a given sector cannot be\n            partially written.\nAdditionally, access to BTT namespaces is cached by the kernel.\nThe drawback is that DAX is not possible for BTT namespaces.\nBlock mode (BLK)\nBlock mode storage addresses each NVDIMM as a separate device. Its use\n         is deprecated and no longer supported.\nApart from\ndevdax\nnamespaces, all other types must be\n      formatted with a file system, just as with a conventional drive.\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nsupports the\next2\n,\next4\nand\nXFS\nfile systems for this.\nDirect access (DAX)\nDAX allows persistent memory to be directly mapped into a process's\n      address space, for example using the\nmmap\nsystem call.\nDIMM physical address (DPA)\nA memory address as an offset into a single DIMM's memory; that is,\n      starting from zero as the lowest addressable byte on that DIMM.\nLabel\nMetadata stored on the NVDIMM, such as namespace definitions. This can be\n      accessed using DSMs.\nDevice-specific method (DSM)\nACPI method to access the firmware on an NVDIMM.\n36.3\nUse cases\n#\n36.3.1\nPMEM with DAX\n#\nIt is important to note that this form of memory access is\nnot\ntransactional. In the event of a power outage or\n    other system failure, data may not be completely written into storage. PMEM\n    storage is only suitable if the application can handle the situation of\n    partially-written data.\n36.3.1.1\nApplications that benefit from large amounts of byte-addressable storage\n#\nIf the server will host an application that can directly use large amounts\n     of fast storage on a byte-by-byte basis, the programmer can use the\nmmap\nsystem call to place blocks of persistent memory directly into the\n     application's address space, without using any additional system RAM.\n36.3.1.2\nAvoiding use of the kernel page cache\n#\nAvoid using the kernel page cache if you want to conserve the use of RAM for the page cache, and instead\n     give it to your applications. For instance, non-volatile memory could be\n     dedicated to holding virtual machine (VM) images. As these would not be\n     cached, this would reduce the cache usage on the host, allowing more VMs\n     per host.\n36.3.2\nPMEM with BTT\n#\nThis is useful when you want to use the persistent memory on a set of\n    NVDIMMs as a disk-like pool of very fast storage. For example, placing\n    the file system journal on PMEM with BTT increases the reliability \n    of file system recovery after a power failure or other sudden\n    interruption (see\nSection 36.5.3, “Creating a PMEM namespace with BTT”\n).\nTo applications, such devices appear as very fast SSDs and can be used\n    like any other storage device. For example, LVM can be layered on top of\n    the persistent memory and will work as normal.\nThe advantage of BTT is that sector write atomicity is guaranteed, so even\n    sophisticated applications that depend on data integrity will keep\n    working. Media error reporting works through standard error-reporting\n    channels.\n36.4\nTools for managing persistent memory\n#\nTo manage persistent memory, it is necessary to install the\nndctl\npackage. This also installs the\nlibndctl\npackage, which provides a set of user space\n   libraries to configure NVDIMMs.\nThese tools work via the\nlibnvdimm\nlibrary, which\n   supports three types of NVDIMM:\nPMEM\nBLK\nSimultaneous PMEM and BLK\nThe\nndctl\nutility has a helpful set of\nman\npages, accessible with the command:\n>\nndctl help\nsubcommand\nTo see a list of available subcommands, use:\n>\nndctl --list-cmds\nThe available subcommands include:\nversion\nDisplays the current version of the NVDIMM support tools.\nenable-namespace\nMakes the specified namespace available for use.\ndisable-namespace\nPrevents the specified namespace from being used.\ncreate-namespace\nCreates a new namespace from the specified storage devices.\ndestroy-namespace\nRemoves the specified namespace.\nenable-region\nMakes the specified region available for use.\ndisable-region\nPrevents the specified region from being used.\nzero-labels\nErases the metadata from a device.\nread-labels\nRetrieves the metadata of the specified device.\nlist\nDisplays available devices.\nhelp\nDisplays information about using the tool.\n36.5\nSetting up persistent memory\n#\n36.5.1\nViewing available NVDIMM storage\n#\nThe\nndctl\nlist\ncommand can be used to\n    list all available NVDIMMs in a system.\nIn the following example, the system has three NVDIMMs, which are in a\n    single, triple-channel interleaved set.\n#\nndctl list --dimms\n[\n {\n  \"dev\":\"nmem2\",\n  \"id\":\"8089-00-0000-12325476\"\n },\n {\n  \"dev\":\"nmem1\",\n  \"id\":\"8089-00-0000-11325476\"\n },\n {\n  \"dev\":\"nmem0\",\n  \"id\":\"8089-00-0000-10325476\"\n }\n]\nWith a different parameter,\nndctl\nlist\nwill also list the available regions.\nNote\nRegions may not appear in numerical order.\nNote that although there are only three NVDIMMs, they appear as four\n    regions.\n#\nndctl list --regions\n[\n {\n  \"dev\":\"region1\",\n  \"size\":68182605824,\n  \"available_size\":68182605824,\n  \"type\":\"blk\"\n },\n {\n  \"dev\":\"region3\",\n  \"size\":202937204736,\n  \"available_size\":202937204736,\n  \"type\":\"pmem\",\n  \"iset_id\":5903239628671731251\n  },\n  {\n   \"dev\":\"region0\",\n   \"size\":68182605824,\n   \"available_size\":68182605824,\n   \"type\":\"blk\"\n  },\n  {\n   \"dev\":\"region2\",\n   \"size\":68182605824,\n   \"available_size\":68182605824,\n   \"type\":\"blk\"\n  }\n]\nThe space is available in two different forms: either as three separate 64\n    GB regions of type BLK, or as one combined 189 GB region of type PMEM which\n    presents all the space on the three interleaved NVDIMMs as a single volume.\nNote that the displayed value for\navailable_size\nis the\n    same as that for\nsize\n. This means that none of the space\n    has been allocated yet.\n36.5.2\nConfiguring the storage as a single PMEM namespace with DAX\n#\nFor the first example, we will configure our three NVDIMMs into a single\n    PMEM namespace with Direct Access (DAX).\nThe first step is to create a new namespace.\n#\nndctl create-namespace --type=\npmem\n--mode=\nfsdax\n--map=\nmemory\n{\n \"dev\":\"namespace3.0\",\n \"mode\":\"memory\",\n \"size\":199764213760,\n \"uuid\":\"dc8ebb84-c564-4248-9e8d-e18543c39b69\",\n \"blockdev\":\"pmem3\"\n}\nThis creates a block device\n/dev/pmem3\n, which supports\n    DAX. The\n3\nin the device name is inherited from the\n    parent region number, in this case\nregion3\n.\nThe\n--map=memory\noption sets aside part of the PMEM\n    storage space on the NVDIMMs so that it can be used to allocate internal\n    kernel data structures called\nstruct pages\n. This allows\n    the new PMEM namespace to be used with features such as\nO_DIRECT\n    I/O\nand\nRDMA\n.\nThe reservation of some persistent memory for kernel data structures is why\n    the resulting PMEM namespace has a smaller capacity than the parent PMEM\n    region.\nNext, we verify that the new block device is available to the operating\n    system:\n#\nfdisk -l /dev/\npmem3\nDisk /dev/pmem3: 186 GiB, 199764213760 bytes, 390164480 sectors\nUnits: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes\nBefore it can be used, like any other drive, it must be formatted. In this\n    example, we format it with XFS:\n#\nmkfs.xfs /dev/\npmem3\nmeta-data=/dev/pmem3      isize=256    agcount=4, agsize=12192640 blks\n         =                sectsz=4096  attr=2, projid32bit=1\n         =                crc=0        finobt=0, sparse=0\ndata     =                bsize=4096   blocks=48770560, imaxpct=25\n         =                sunit=0      swidth=0 blks\nnaming   =version 2       bsize=4096   ascii-ci=0 ftype=1\nlog      =internal log    bsize=4096   blocks=23813, version=2\n         =                sectsz=4096  sunit=1 blks, lazy-count=1\nrealtime =none            extsz=4096   blocks=0, rtextents=0\nNext, we can mount the new drive onto a directory:\n#\nmount -o dax /dev/\npmem3\n/mnt/\npmem3\nThen we can verify that we now have a DAX-capable device:\n#\nmount | grep dax\n/dev/pmem3 on /mnt/pmem3 type xfs (rw,relatime,attr2,dax,inode64,noquota)\nThe result is that we now have a PMEM namespace formatted with the XFS file\n    system and mounted with DAX.\nAny\nmmap()\ncalls to files in that file system will\n    return virtual addresses that directly map to the persistent memory on our\n    NVDIMMs, completely bypassing the page cache.\nAny\nfsync\nor\nmsync\ncalls on files in\n    that file system will still ensure that modified data has been fully\n    written to the NVDIMMs. These calls flush the processor cache lines\n    associated with any pages that have been modified in user space via\nmmap\nmappings.\n36.5.2.1\nRemoving a namespace\n#\nBefore creating any other type of volume that uses the same storage, we\n     must unmount and then remove this PMEM volume.\nFirst, unmount it:\n#\numount /mnt/\npmem3\nThen disable the namespace:\n#\nndctl disable-namespace\nnamespace3.0\ndisabled 1 namespace\nThen delete it:\n#\nndctl destroy-namespace\nnamespace3.0\ndestroyed 1 namespace\n36.5.3\nCreating a PMEM namespace with BTT\n#\nBTT provides sector write atomicity, which makes it a good choice\n     when you need data protection, for example for Ext4 and XFS journals. \n     If there is a power failure, the journals\n     are protected and should be recoverable. The following examples\n     show how to create a PMEM namespace with BTT in sector mode, and how\n     to place the file system journal in this namespace.\n#\nndctl create-namespace --type=pmem --mode=sector\n{\n \"dev\":\"namespace3.0\",\n \"mode\":\"sector\",\n \"uuid\":\"51ab652d-7f20-44ea-b51d-5670454f8b9b\",\n \"sector_size\":4096,\n \"blockdev\":\"pmem3s\"\n}\nNext, verify that the new device is present:\n#\nfdisk -l /dev/\npmem3s\nDisk /dev/pmem3s: 188.8 GiB, 202738135040 bytes, 49496615 sectors\nUnits: sectors of 1 * 4096 = 4096 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes\nLike the DAX-capable PMEM namespace we previously configured, this\n    BTT-capable PMEM namespace consumes all the available storage on the\n    NVDIMMs.\nNote\nThe trailing\ns\nin the device name\n     (\n/dev/\npmem3s\n) stands for\nsector\nand can be used to easily distinguish namespaces\n     that are configured to use the BTT.\nThe volume can be formatted and mounted as in the previous example.\nThe PMEM namespace shown here cannot use DAX. Instead it uses the BTT to\n    provide\nsector write atomicity\n. On each sector write\n    through the PMEM block driver, the BTT will allocate a new sector to\n    receive the new data. The BTT atomically updates its internal mapping\n    structures after the new data is fully written so the newly written data\n    will be available to applications. If the power fails at any point during\n    this process, the write will be completely lost and the application will\n    have access to its old data, still intact. This prevents the condition\n    known as \"torn sectors\".\nThis BTT-enabled PMEM namespace can be formatted and used with a file system\n    same as any other standard block device. It cannot be used with DAX.\n    However,\nmmap\nmappings for files on this block device\n    will use the page cache.\n36.5.4\nPlacing the file system journal on PMEM/BTT\n#\nWhen you place the file system journal on a separate device, it\n      must use the same file system block size as the file system. Most \n      likely this is 4096, and you can find the block size with this \n      command:\n#\nblockdev --getbsz /dev/\nsda3\nThe following example creates a new Ext4 journal on a separate \n      NVDIMM device, creates the file system on a SATA device, then \n      attaches the new file system to the journal:\n#\nmke2fs -b 4096 -O journal_dev /dev/\npmem3s\n#\nmkfs.ext4 -J device=/dev/\npmem3s\n/dev/\nsda3\nThe following example creates a new XFS file system on a SATA drive,\n      and creates the journal on a separate NVDIMM device:\n#\nmkfs.xfs -l logdev=/dev/\npmem3s\n/dev/\nsda3\nSee\nman 8 mkfs.ext4\nand\nman 8 mkfs.ext4\nfor detailed information about options.\n36.6\nMore information\n#\nMore about this topic can be found in the following list:\nPersistent Memory Wiki\nContains instructions for configuring NVDIMM systems, information about\n     testing, and links to specifications related to NVDIMM enabling.

New\n    in\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n15 SP4\nis YaST support for\nsystemd\nsocket-based\n    services activation, which configures services to start on demand.\nsystemd\nsupports starting services with socket-based activation, for starting\n  services on demand. These services have two unit types: service and socket.\n  For example, CUPS is controlled by\ncups.service\nand\ncups.socket\n. YaST allows you to select the type of\n  service start-up you want to use.\nFigure 37.1, “YaST service manager”\nshows the options in the Start Mode\n  drop-down box:\nOn Boot\n,\nOn Demand\n, and\nManually\n. Select\nOn Demand\nfor\n  socket-based activation. This opens a listening network socket, and the\n  service starts when there is a request.\nFigure 37.1:\nYaST service manager\n#\nThe\nOn Demand\noption is visible only for services that\n  support it. Currently this is a small subset of services, such as CUPS, dbus,\n  iscsid, iscsiuio, multipathd, pcscd, rpcbind, TFTP, virtlockd, virtlogd. See\nman 5 systemd.socket\nfor detailed information on how\n  socket activation works.\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

In this way, the IP address 192.168.2.100 is assigned to\n    the host name\njupiter\n, for example. Before setting up your\n    own name server, read the general information about DNS in\nSection 23.3, “Name resolution”\n. The following configuration\n    examples refer to BIND, the default DNS server.\n39.1\nDNS terminology\n#\nZone\nThe domain name space is divided into regions called zones. For example,\n      if you have\nexample.com\n, you have the\nexample\nsection (or zone) of the\ncom\ndomain.\nDNS server\nThe DNS server is a server that maintains the name and IP information for\n      a domain. You can have a primary DNS server for primary zone, a secondary\n      server for secondary zone, or a secondary server without any zones for caching.\nPrimary zone DNS server\nThe primary zone includes all hosts from your network and a DNS server\n         primary zone stores up-to-date records for all the hosts in your\n         domain.\nSecondary zone DNS server\nA secondary zone is a copy of the primary zone. The secondary zone DNS server\n         obtains its zone data with zone transfer operations from its primary\n         server. The secondary zone DNS server responds authoritatively for the\n         zone if it has valid (not expired) zone data. If the secondary server\n         cannot obtain a new copy of the zone data, it stops responding for the\n         zone.\nForwarder\nForwarders are DNS servers to which your DNS server should send queries\n      it cannot answer. To enable different configuration sources in one\n      configuration,\nnetconfig\nis used (see also\nman 8 netconfig\n).\nRecord\nThe record is information about name and IP address. Supported records\n      and their syntax are described in BIND documentation. Some special\n      records are:\nNS record\nAn NS record tells name servers which machines are in charge of a\n         given domain zone.\nMX record\nThe MX (mail exchange) records describe the machines to contact for\n         directing mail across the Internet.\nSOA record\nSOA (Start of Authority) record is the first record in a zone file.\n         The SOA record is used when using DNS to synchronize data between\n         multiple computers.\n39.2\nInstallation\n#\nTo install a DNS server, start YaST and select\nSoftware\n›\nSoftware\n   Management\n. Choose\nView\n›\nPatterns\nand select\nDHCP and DNS Server\n. Confirm the installation\n   of the dependent packages to finish the installation process.\nAlternatively use the following command on the command line:\n>\nsudo\nzypper in -t pattern dhcp_dns_server\n39.3\nConfiguration with YaST\n#\nUse the YaST DNS module to configure a DNS server for the local network.\n   When starting the module for the first time, a wizard starts, prompting you\n   to make a few decisions concerning administration of the server. Completing\n   this initial setup produces a basic server configuration. Use the expert\n   mode to deal with more advanced configuration tasks, such as setting up\n   ACLs, logging, TSIG keys, and other options.\n39.3.1\nWizard configuration\n#\nThe wizard consists of three steps or dialogs. At the appropriate places\n    in the dialogs, you can enter the expert configuration mode.\nWhen starting the module for the first time, the\nForwarder\n      Settings\ndialog, shown in\nFigure 39.1, “DNS server installation: forwarder settings”\n, opens. The\nLocal\n      DNS Resolution Policy\nallows to set the following options:\nMerging forwarders is disabled\nAutomatic merging\nMerging forwarders is enabled\nCustom configuration\n—If\nCustom\n        configuration\nis selected,\nCustom policy\ncan be specified; by default (with\nAutomatic merging\nselected),\nCustom policy\nis set to\nauto\n, but here you can either set interface names or\n        select from the two special policy names\nSTATIC\nand\nSTATIC_FALLBACK\n.\nIn\nLocal DNS Resolution Forwarder\n, specify which\n      service to use:\nUsing system name servers\n,\nThis name server (bind)\n, or\nLocal dnsmasq\n      server\n.\nFor more information about all these settings, see\nman 8\n      netconfig\n.\nFigure 39.1:\nDNS server installation: forwarder settings\n#\nForwarders are DNS servers to which your DNS server sends queries it\n      cannot answer itself. Enter their IP address and click\nAdd\n.\nThe\nDNS Zones\ndialog consists of several parts and is\n      responsible for the management of zone files, described in\nSection 39.6, “Zone files”\n. For a new zone, provide a name for it\n      in\nName\n. To add a reverse zone, the name must end in\n.in-addr.arpa\n. Finally, select the\nType\n(primary, secondary, or forward). See\nFigure 39.2, “DNS server installation: DNS zones”\n. Click\nEdit\nto configure other settings of an existing zone. To remove a zone, click\nDelete\n.\nFigure 39.2:\nDNS server installation: DNS zones\n#\nIn the final dialog, you can open the DNS port in the firewall by\n      clicking\nOpen Port in Firewall\n. Then decide whether to\n      start the DNS server when booting (\nOn\nor\nOff\n). You can also activate LDAP support. See\nFigure 39.3, “DNS server installation: finish wizard”\n.\nFigure 39.3:\nDNS server installation: finish wizard\n#\n39.3.2\nExpert configuration\n#\nAfter starting the module, YaST opens a window displaying several\n    configuration options. Completing it results in a DNS server configuration\n    with the basic functions in place:\n39.3.2.1\nStart-up\n#\nUnder\nStart-Up\n, define whether the DNS server should be\n     started when the booting the system or manually. To start the DNS server\n     immediately, click\nStart DNS Server Now\n. To stop the\n     DNS server, click\nStop DNS Server Now\n. To save the\n     current settings, select\nSave Settings and Reload DNS Server\n     Now\n.\n\n     You can open the DNS port in the firewall with\nOpen Port in\n     Firewall\nand modify the firewall settings with\nFirewall\n     Details\n.\nBy selecting\nLDAP Support Active\n, the zone files are\n     managed by an LDAP database. Any changes to zone data written to the LDAP\n     database are picked up by the DNS server when it is restarted or prompted\n     to reload its configuration.\n39.3.2.2\nForwarders\n#\nIf your local DNS server cannot answer a request, it tries to forward the\n     request to a\nForwarder\n, if configured so. This\n     forwarder may be added manually to the\nForwarder List\n.\n     If the forwarder is not static like in dial-up connections,\nnetconfig\nhandles the configuration. For more\n     information about netconfig, see\nman 8 netconfig\n.\n39.3.2.3\nBasic options\n#\nIn this section, set basic server options. From the\nOption\nmenu, select the desired item then specify the\n     value in the corresponding text box. Include the new entry by selecting\nAdd\n.\n39.3.2.4\nLogging\n#\nTo set what the DNS server should log and how, select\nLogging\n. Under\nLog Type\n, specify\n     where the DNS server should write the log data. Use the system-wide log by\n     selecting\nSystem Log\nor specify a different file by\n     selecting\nFile\n. In the latter case, additionally\n     specify a name, the maximum file size in megabytes and the number of log\n     file versions to store.\nFurther options are available under\nAdditional Logging\n.\n     Enabling\nLog All DNS Queries\ncauses\nevery\nquery to be logged, in which case the log file\n     could grow extremely large. For this reason, it is not a good idea to\n     enable this option for other than debugging purposes. To log the data\n     traffic during zone updates between DHCP and DNS server, enable\nLog Zone Updates\n. To log the data traffic during a zone\n     transfer from primary to secondary server, enable\nLog Zone\n     Transfer\n. See\nFigure 39.4, “DNS server: logging”\n.\nFigure 39.4:\nDNS server: logging\n#\n39.3.2.5\nACLs\n#\nUse this dialog to define ACLs (access control lists) to enforce access\n     restrictions. After providing a distinct name under\nName\n, specify an IP address (with or without netmask)\n     under\nValue\nin the following fashion:\n{ 192.168.1/24; }\nThe syntax of the configuration file requires that the address ends with a\n     semicolon and is put into curly braces.\n39.3.2.6\nTSIG keys\n#\nThe main purpose of TSIGs (transaction signatures) is to secure\n     communications between DHCP and DNS servers. They are described in\nSection 39.8, “Secure transactions”\n.\nTo generate a TSIG key, enter a distinctive name in the field labeled\nKey ID\nand specify the file where the key should be\n     stored (\nFilename\n). Confirm your choices with\nGenerate\n.\nTo use a previously created key, leave the\nKey ID\nfield\n     blank and select the file where it is stored under\nFilename\n. After that, confirm with\nAdd\n.\n39.3.2.7\nDNS zones (adding a secondary zone)\n#\nTo add a secondary zone, select\nDNS Zones\n, choose the zone\n     type\nSecondary\n, write the name of the new zone, and click\nAdd\n.\nIn the\nZone Editor\nsub-dialog under\nPrimary DNS\n     Server IP\n, specify the primary server from which the secondary server should pull\n     its data. To limit access to the server, select one of the ACLs from the\n     list.\n39.3.2.8\nDNS zones (adding a primary zone)\n#\nTo add a primary zone, select\nDNS Zones\n, choose the zone\n     type\nPrimary\n, write the name of the new zone, and click\nAdd\n. When adding a primary zone, a reverse zone is also\n     needed. For example, when adding the zone\nexample.com\nthat points to hosts in a subnet\n192.168.1.0/24\n, you should also add a reverse zone for\n     the IP-address range covered. By definition, this should be named\n1.168.192.in-addr.arpa\n.\n39.3.2.9\nDNS zones (editing a primary zone)\n#\nTo edit a primary zone, select\nDNS Zones\n, select the\n     primary zone from the table and click\nEdit\n. The dialog\n     consists of several pages:\nBasics\n(the one opened\n     first),\nNS Records\n,\nMX Records\n,\nSOA\n, and\nRecords\n.\nThe basic dialog, shown in\nFigure 39.5, “DNS server: Zone Editor (Basics)”\n, lets you\n     define settings for dynamic DNS and access options for zone transfers to\n     clients and secondary name servers. To permit the dynamic updating of zones,\n     select\nAllow Dynamic Updates\nand the\n     corresponding TSIG key. The key must have been defined before the update\n     action starts. To enable zone transfers, select the corresponding ACLs.\n     ACLs must have been defined already.\nIn the\nBasics\ndialog, select whether to enable zone\n     transfers. Use the listed ACLs to define who can download zones.\nFigure 39.5:\nDNS server: Zone Editor (Basics)\n#\nZone Editor (NS Records)\nThe\nNS Records\ndialog allows you to define\n        alternative name servers for the zones specified. Make sure that your\n        own name server is included in the list. To add a record, enter its\n        name under\nName Server to Add\nthen confirm with\nAdd\n. See\nFigure 39.6, “DNS server: Zone Editor (NS Records)”\n.\nFigure 39.6:\nDNS server: Zone Editor (NS Records)\n#\nZone Editor (MX Records)\nTo add a mail server for the current zone to the existing list, enter\n        the corresponding address and priority value. After doing so, confirm\n        by selecting\nAdd\n. See\nFigure 39.7, “DNS server: Zone Editor (MX Records)”\n.\nFigure 39.7:\nDNS server: Zone Editor (MX Records)\n#\nZone Editor (SOA)\nThis page allows you to create SOA (start of authority) records. For an\n        explanation of the individual options, refer to\nExample 39.6, “The /var/lib/named/example.com.zone file”\n.\nChanging SOA\n        records is not supported for dynamic zones managed via LDAP.\nFigure 39.8:\nDNS server: Zone Editor (SOA)\n#\nZone Editor (Records)\nThis dialog manages name resolution. In\nRecord Key\n,\n        enter the host name then select its type. The\nA\ntype\n        represents the main entry. The value for this should be an IP address\n        (IPv4). Use\nAAAA\nfor IPv6 addresses.\nCNAME\nis an alias. Use the types\nNS\nand\nMX\nfor detailed or partial\n        records that expand on the information provided in the\nNS\n        Records\nand\nMX Records\ntabs. These three\n        types resolve to an existing\nA\nrecord.\nPTR\nis for reverse zones. It is the opposite of an\nA\nrecord, for example:\nhostname.example.com. IN A 192.168.0.1\n1.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa IN PTR hostname.example.com.\n39.3.2.9.1\nAdding reverse zones\n#\nTo add a reverse zone, follow this procedure:\nStart\nYaST\n›\nDNS\n        Server\n›\nDNS Zones\n.\nIf you have not added a primary forward zone, add it and\nEdit\nit.\nIn the\nRecords\ntab, fill the corresponding\nRecord Key\nand\nValue\n, then add\n        the record with\nAdd\nand confirm with\nOK\n. If YaST complains about a non-existing record\n        for a name server, add it in the\nNS Records\ntab.\nFigure 39.9:\nAdding a record for a primary zone\n#\nBack in the\nDNS Zones\nwindow, add a reverse primary\n        zone.\nFigure 39.10:\nAdding a reverse zone\n#\nEdit\nthe reverse zone, and in the\nRecords\ntab, you can see the\nPTR: Reverse\n        translation\nrecord type. Add the corresponding\nRecord Key\nand\nValue\n, then click\nAdd\nand confirm with\nOK\n.\nFigure 39.11:\nAdding a reverse record\n#\nAdd a name server record if needed.\nTip: Editing the reverse zone\nAfter adding a forward zone, go back to the main menu and select the\n       reverse zone for editing. There in the tab\nBasics\nactivate the check box\nAutomatically Generate Records\n       From\nand select your forward zone. That way, all changes to\n       the forward zone are automatically updated in the reverse zone.\n39.4\nStarting the BIND name server\n#\nOn a\nSUSE® Linux Enterprise Server\nsystem, the name server BIND (\nBerkeley\n   Internet Name Domain\n) comes preconfigured, so it can be started\n   right after installation without any problems. Normally, if you already have an Internet connection and entered\n127.0.0.1\nas the name server\n   address for\nlocalhost\nin\n/var/run/netconfig/resolv.conf\n, you already have a working\n   name resolution without needing to know the DNS of the provider. BIND\n   carries out name resolution via the root name server, a notably slower\n   process. Normally, the DNS of the provider should be entered with its IP\n   address in the configuration file\n/etc/named.conf\nunder\nforwarders\nto ensure effective and secure name\n   resolution. If this works so far, the name server runs as a pure\ncaching-only\nname server. Only when you configure its\n   own zones it becomes a proper DNS. Find a simple example documented in\n/usr/share/doc/packages/bind/config\n.\nTip: Automatic adaptation of the name server information\nDepending on the type of Internet connection or the network connection, the\n    name server information can automatically be adapted to the current\n    conditions. To do this, set the\nNETCONFIG_DNS_POLICY\nvariable in the\n/etc/sysconfig/network/config\nfile to\nauto\n.\nHowever, do not set up an official domain until one is assigned to you by\n   the responsible institution. Even if you have your own domain and it is\n   managed by the provider, you are better off not using it, because BIND would\n   otherwise not forward requests for this domain. The Web server at the\n   provider, for example, would not be accessible for this domain.\nTo start the name server, enter the command\nsystemctl start\n   named\nas\nroot\n. Check\n   with\nsystemctl status named\nwhether named (as the name\n   server process is called) has been started successfully. Test the name\n   server immediately on the local system with the\nhost\nor\ndig\nprograms, which should return\nlocalhost\nas the default server\n   with the address\n127.0.0.1\n. If\n   this is not the case,\n/var/run/netconfig/resolv.conf\nprobably\n   contains an incorrect name server entry or the file does not exist. For the\n   first test, enter\nhost\n127.0.0.1\n,\n   which should always work. If you get an error message, use\nsystemctl status named\nto see whether the server is\n   actually running. If the name server does not start or behaves unexpectedly,\n   check the output of\njournalctl -e\n.\nTo use the name server of the provider (or one already running on your\n   network) as the forwarder, enter the corresponding IP address or addresses\n   in the\noptions\nsection under\nforwarders\n. The addresses included in\nExample 39.1, “Forwarding options in named.conf”\nare examples only. Adjust these entries to your\n   own setup.\nExample 39.1:\nForwarding options in named.conf\n#\noptions {\n        directory \"/var/lib/named\";\n        forwarders { 10.11.12.13; 10.11.12.14; };\n        listen-on { 127.0.0.1; 192.168.1.116; };\n        allow-query { 127/8; 192.168/16 };\n        notify no;\n};\nThe\noptions\nentry is followed by entries for the\n   zone,\nlocalhost\n, and\n0.0.127.in-addr.arpa\n. The\ntype\n   hint\nentry under\n“\n.\n”\nshould always be present. The\n   corresponding files do not need to be modified and should work as they are.\n   Also make sure that each entry is closed with a\n“\n;\n”\nand that\n   the curly braces are in the correct places. After changing the configuration\n   file\n/etc/named.conf\nor the zone files, tell BIND to\n   reread them with\nsystemctl reload named\n. Achieve the same\n   by stopping and restarting the name server with\nsystemctl restart\n   named\n. Stop the server at any time by entering\nsystemctl\n   stop named\n.\n39.5\nThe /etc/named.conf configuration file\n#\nAll the settings for the BIND name server itself are stored in the\n/etc/named.conf\nfile. However, the zone data for the\n   domains to handle (consisting of the host names, IP addresses, and so on)\n   are stored in separate files in the\n/var/lib/named\ndirectory. The details of this are described later.\n/etc/named.conf\nis roughly divided into two areas. One\n   is the\noptions\nsection for general settings and the\n   other consists of\nzone\nentries for the individual\n   domains. A\nlogging\nsection and\nacl\n(access control list) entries are optional.\n   Comment lines begin with a\n#\nsign or\n//\n. A minimal\n/etc/named.conf\nis\n   shown in\nExample 39.2, “A basic /etc/named.conf”\n.\nExample 39.2:\nA basic /etc/named.conf\n#\noptions {\n        directory \"/var/lib/named\";\n        forwarders { 10.0.0.1; };\n        notify no;\n};\n\nzone \"localhost\" in {\n       type master;\n       file \"localhost.zone\";\n};\n\nzone \"0.0.127.in-addr.arpa\" in {\n        type master;\n        file \"127.0.0.zone\";\n};\n\nzone \".\" in {\n        type hint;\n        file \"root.hint\";\n};\n39.5.1\nImportant configuration options\n#\ndirectory \"\nFILENAME\n\";\nSpecifies the directory in which BIND can find the files containing the\n       zone data. Usually, this is\n/var/lib/named\n.\nforwarders {\nIP-ADDRESS\n; };\nSpecifies the name servers (mostly of the provider) to which DNS\n       requests should be forwarded if they cannot be resolved directly.\n       Replace\nIP-ADDRESS\nwith an IP address like\n192.168.1.116\n.\nforward first;\nCauses DNS requests to be forwarded before an attempt is made to resolve\n       them via the root name servers. Instead of\nforward\n       first\n,\nforward only\ncan be written\n       to have all requests forwarded and none sent to the root name servers.\n       This makes sense for firewall configurations.\nlisten-on port 53 { 127.0.0.1;\nIP-ADDRESS\n; };\nTells BIND on which network interfaces and port to accept client\n       queries.\nport 53\ndoes not need to be specified\n       explicitly, because\n53\nis the default port. Enter\n127.0.0.1\nto permit requests from the local host. If\n       you omit this entry entirely, all interfaces are used by default.\nlisten-on-v6 port 53 {any; };\nTells BIND on which port it should listen for IPv6 client requests. The\n       only alternative to\nany\nis\nnone\n.\n       As far as IPv6 is concerned, the server only accepts wild card\n       addresses.\nquery-source address * port 53;\nThis entry is necessary if a firewall is blocking outgoing DNS requests.\n       This tells BIND to post requests externally from port 53 and not from\n       any of the high ports above 1024.\nquery-source-v6 address * port 53;\nTells BIND which port to use for IPv6 queries.\nallow-query { 127.0.0.1;\nNET\n; };\nDefines the networks from which clients can post DNS requests. Replace\nNET\nwith address information like\n192.168.2.0/24\n. The\n/24\nat\n       the end is an abbreviated expression for the netmask (in this case\n255.255.255.0\n).\nallow-transfer  ! *;;\nControls which hosts can request zone transfers. In the example, such\n       requests are completely denied with\n! *\n.\n       Without this entry, zone transfers can be requested from anywhere\n       without restrictions.\nstatistics-interval 0;\nIn the absence of this entry, BIND generates several lines of\n       statistical information per hour in the system's journal. Set it to 0 to\n       suppress these statistics completely or set an interval in minutes.\ncleaning-interval 720;\nThis option defines at which time intervals BIND clears its cache. This\n       triggers an entry in the system's journal each time it occurs. The time\n       specification is in minutes. The default is 60 minutes.\ninterface-interval 0;\nBIND regularly searches the network interfaces for new or nonexistent\n       interfaces. If this value is set to\n0\n, this is\n       not done and BIND only listens at the interfaces detected at start-up.\n       Otherwise, the interval can be defined in minutes. The default is sixty\n       minutes.\nnotify no;\nno\nprevents other name servers from being informed when\n       changes are made to the zone data or when the name server is restarted.\nFor a list of available options, read the manual page\nman 5\n    named.conf\n.\n39.5.2\nLogging\n#\nWhat, how, and where logging takes place can be extensively configured in\n    BIND. Normally, the default settings should be sufficient.\nExample 39.3, “Entry to disable logging”\n, shows the simplest form of such an entry and\n    completely suppresses any logging.\nExample 39.3:\nEntry to disable logging\n#\nlogging {\n        category default { null; };\n};\n39.5.3\nZone entries\n#\nExample 39.4:\nZone entry for example.com\n#\nzone \"example.com\" in {\n      type master;\n      file \"example.com.zone\";\n      notify no;\n};\nAfter\nzone\n, specify the name of the domain to\n    administer (\nexample.com\n)\n    followed by\nin\nand a block of relevant options\n    enclosed in curly braces, as shown in\nExample 39.4, “Zone entry for example.com”\n. To\n    define a\nsecondary zone\n, switch the\ntype\nto\nsecondary\nand specify a\n    name server that administers this zone as\nprimary\n(which,\n    in turn, may be a secondary server of another primary server), as shown in\nExample 39.5, “Zone entry for example.net”\n.\nExample 39.5:\nZone entry for example.net\n#\nzone \"example.net\" in {\n      type secondary;\n      file \"secondary/example.net.zone\";\n      \n      masters { 10.0.0.1; }; \n};\nThe zone options:\ntype primary;\nBy specifying\nprimary\n, tell BIND that the zone is\n       handled by the local name server. This assumes that a zone file has been\n       created in the correct format.\ntype secondary;\nThis zone is transferred from another name server. It must be used\n       together with\nprimary_servers\n.\ntype hint;\nThe zone\n.\nof the\nhint\ntype is\n       used to set the root name servers. This zone definition can be left as\n       is.\nfile\nexample.com.zone\nor file\n“\nsecondary/example.net.zone\n”\n;\nThis entry specifies the file where zone data for the domain is located.\n       This file is not required for a secondary server, because this data is pulled from\n       another name server. To differentiate files of the primary and secondary server, use the\n       directory\nsecondary\nfor the secondary files.\nprimary_servers {\nSERVER_IP_ADDRESS\n; };\nThis entry is only needed for secondary zones. It specifies from which name\n       server the zone file should be transferred.\nallow-update {! *; };\nThis option controls external write access, which would allow clients to\n       make a DNS entry—something not normally desirable for security\n       reasons. Without this entry, zone updates are not allowed. The above\n       entry achieves the same because\n! *\neffectively bans\n       any such activity.\n39.6\nZone files\n#\nTwo types of zone files are needed. One assigns IP addresses to host names\n   and the other does the reverse: it supplies a host name for an IP address.\nTip: Using the dot (period, full stop) in zone files\nThe\n\".\"\nhas an important meaning in the zone files. If\n    host names are given without a final dot (\n.\n), the zone\n    is appended. Complete host names specified with a full domain name must end\n    with a dot (\n.\n) to avoid having the domain added to it\n    again. A missing or wrongly placed \".\" is probably the most frequent cause\n    of name server configuration errors.\nThe first case to consider is the zone file\nexample.com.zone\n, responsible for the domain\nexample.com\n, shown in\nExample 39.6, “The /var/lib/named/example.com.zone file”\n.\nExample 39.6:\nThe /var/lib/named/example.com.zone file\n#\n$TTL 2D\n1\nexample.com. IN SOA      dns  root.example.com. (\n2\n2003072441  ; serial\n3\n1D          ; refresh\n4\n2H          ; retry\n5\n1W          ; expiry\n6\n2D )        ; minimum\n7\nIN NS       dns\n8\nIN MX       10 mail dns\n9\ngate         IN A        192.168.5.1\n10\nIN A        10.0.0.1\ndns          IN A        192.168.1.116\nmail         IN A        192.168.3.108\njupiter      IN A        192.168.2.100\nvenus        IN A        192.168.2.101\nsaturn       IN A        192.168.2.102\nmercury      IN A        192.168.2.103\nntp          IN CNAME    dns\n11\ndns6         IN A6  0    2002:c0a8:174::\n1\n$TTL\ndefines the default time to live that\n     should apply to all the entries in this file. In this example, entries\n     are valid for a period of two days (\n2 D\n).\n2\nThis is where the SOA (start of authority) control record begins:\nThe name of the domain to administer is\nexample.com\nin the first position. This ends\n       with\n\".\"\n, because otherwise the zone would be\n       appended a second time. Alternatively,\n@\ncan be\n       entered here, in which case the zone would be extracted from the\n       corresponding entry in\n/etc/named.conf\n.\nAfter\nIN SOA\nis the name of the name server in\n       charge as a primary server for this zone. The name is expanded from\ndns\nto\ndns.example.com\n, because it does\n       not end with a\n\".\"\n.\nAn e-mail address of the person in charge of this name server follows.\n       Because the\n@\nsign already has a special meaning,\n\".\"\nis entered here instead. For\nroot@example.com\nthe entry must read\nroot.example.com.\n. The\n\".\"\nmust be included at the end to prevent the zone\n       from being added.\nThe\n(\nincludes all lines up to\n)\ninto the SOA record.\n3\nThe\nserial number\nis a 10-digit number. It must\n     be changed each time this file is changed. It is needed to inform the\n     secondary name servers (secondary servers) of changes. For this, a 10-digit\n     number of the date and run number, written as YYYYMMDDNN, has become the\n     customary format (YYYY = year, MM = month and DD = day. NN is a\n     sequence number in case you update it more than once on the given day).\n4\nThe\nrefresh rate\nspecifies the time interval at\n     which the secondary name servers verify the zone\nserial\n     number\n. In this case, one day.\n5\nThe\nretry rate\nspecifies the time interval at\n     which a secondary name server, in case of error, attempts to contact the\n     primary server again. Here, two hours.\n6\nThe\nexpiration time\nspecifies the time frame\n     after which a secondary name server discards the cached data if it has\n     not regained contact to the primary server. Here, a week.\n7\nThe last entry in the SOA record specifies the\nnegative\n     caching TTL\n—the time for which results of unresolved\n     DNS queries from other servers may be cached.\n8\nThe\nIN NS\nspecifies the name server responsible\n     for this domain.\ndns\nis extended to\ndns.example.com\nbecause it does not end with a\n\".\"\n. There can be several lines like this—one for\n     the primary and one for each secondary name server. If\nnotify\nis not set to\nno\nin\n/etc/named.conf\n, all the name servers listed here are\n     informed of the changes made to the zone data.\n9\nThe MX record specifies the mail server that accepts, processes, and\n     forwards e-mails for the domain\nexample.com\n. In this example, this is\n     the host\nmail.example.com\n. The\n     number in front of the host name is the preference value. If there are\n     multiple MX entries, the mail server with the smallest value is taken\n     first. If mail delivery to this server fails, the entry with the\n     next-smallest value is used.\n10\nThis and the following lines are the actual address records where one or more IP addresses are\n      assigned to host names. The names are listed here without a\n\".\"\nbecause they do not include their domain, so\nexample.com\nis added to\n      all of them. Two IP addresses are assigned to the host\ngate\n, as it has two network cards.\n\n      Wherever the host address is a traditional one (IPv4), the record is\n      marked with\nA\n. If the address is an IPv6 address, the\n      entry is marked with\nAAAA\n.\nNote: IPv6 syntax\nThe IPv6 record has a slightly different syntax than IPv4. Because of\n       the fragmentation possibility, it is necessary to provide information\n       about missed bits before the address. To fill up the IPv6 address with\n       the needed number of\n“\n0\n”\n, add two colons at the correct\n       place in the address.\npluto     AAAA 2345:00C1:CA11::1234:5678:9ABC:DEF0\npluto     AAAA 2345:00D2:DA11::1234:5678:9ABC:DEF0\n11\nThe alias\nntp\ncan be used to address\ndns\n(\nCNAME\nmeans\ncanonical name\n).\nThe pseudo domain\nin-addr.arpa\nis used for the reverse\n   lookup of IP addresses into host names. It is appended to the network part\n   of the address in reverse notation. So\n192.168\nis resolved into\n168.192.in-addr.arpa\n. See\nExample 39.7, “Reverse lookup”\n.\nExample 39.7:\nReverse lookup\n#\n$TTL 2D\n1\n168.192.in-addr.arpa.   IN SOA dns.example.com. root.example.com. (\n2\n2003072441      ; serial\n                        1D              ; refresh\n                        2H              ; retry\n                        1W              ; expiry\n                        2D )            ; minimum\n\n                        IN NS           dns.example.com.\n3\n1.5                     IN PTR          gate.example.com.\n4\n100.3                   IN PTR          www.example.com.\n253.2                   IN PTR          cups.example.com.\n1\n$TTL defines the standard TTL that applies to all entries here.\n2\nThe configuration file should activate reverse lookup for the network\n192.168\n. Given\n     that the zone is called\n168.192.in-addr.arpa\n, it\n     should not be added to the host names. Therefore, all host names are\n     entered in their complete form—with their domain and with a\n\".\"\nat the end. The remaining entries correspond to\n     those described for the previous\nexample.com\nexample.\nSee\nExample 39.6, “The /var/lib/named/example.com.zone file”\nfor detail on the entries within this\n     record.\n3\nThis line specifies the name server responsible for this zone. This time,\n     however, the name is entered in its complete form with the domain and a\n\".\"\nat the end.\n4\nThis, and the following lines, are the pointer records hinting at the IP\n     addresses on the respective hosts. Only the last part of the IP address is\n     entered at the beginning of the line, without the\n\".\"\nat the end.  Appending the zone to this (without the\n.in-addr.arpa\n) results in the complete IP address\n     in reverse order.\nNormally, zone transfers between different versions of BIND should be\n   possible without any problems.\n39.7\nDynamic update of zone data\n#\nThe term\ndynamic update\nrefers to operations by which\n   entries in the zone files of a primary server are added, changed, or deleted.\n   This mechanism is described in RFC 2136. Dynamic update is configured\n   individually for each zone entry by adding an optional\nallow-update\nor\nupdate-policy\nrule. Zones to update dynamically\n   should not be edited by hand.\nTransmit the entries to update to the server with the command\nnsupdate\n. For the exact syntax of this command, check the\n   manual page for nsupdate (\nman\n8\n   nsupdate\n). For security reasons, any such update should be\n   performed using TSIG keys as described in\nSection 39.8, “Secure transactions”\n.\n39.8\nSecure transactions\n#\nSecure transactions can be made with transaction signatures (TSIGs) based on\n   shared secret keys (also called TSIG keys). This section describes how to\n   generate and use such keys.\nSecure transactions are needed for communication between different servers\n   and for the dynamic update of zone data. Making the access control dependent\n   on keys is much more secure than merely relying on IP addresses.\nGenerate a TSIG key with the following command (for details, see\nman\ntsig-keygen\n):\n>\nsudo\ntsig-keygen -a hmac-md5 host1-host2 > host1-host2.key\nThis creates a file with the name\nhost1-host2.key\nwith\n   contents that may look as follows:\nkey \"host1-host2\" {                       |\n    algorithm hmac-md5;\n    secret \"oHpBLgtcZso6wxnRTWdJMA==\";\n};\nThe file must be transferred to the remote host, preferably in a secure way\n   (using scp, for example). To enable a secure communication between\nhost1\nand\nhost2\n, the key must be\n   included in the\n/etc/named.conf\nfile on both the local\n   and the remote\n   server.\nkey host1-host2 {\n algorithm hmac-md5;\n secret \"ejIkuCyyGJwwuN3xAteKgg==\";\n};\nWarning: File permissions of\n/etc/named.conf\nMake sure that the permissions of\n/etc/named.conf\nare\n    properly restricted. The default for this file is\n0640\n,\n    with the owner being\nroot\nand the\n    group\nnamed\n. As an alternative,\n    move the keys to an extra file with specially limited permissions, which is\n    then included from\n/etc/named.conf\n. To include an\n    external file, use:\ninclude  \"filename\"\nReplace\nfilename\nwith an absolute path to your file with\n    keys.\nTo enable the server\nhost1\nto use the key for\nhost2\n(which has the address\n10.1.2.3\nin this example), the server's\n/etc/named.conf\nmust\n   include the following rule:\nserver 10.1.2.3 {\n  keys { host1-host2. ;};\n};\nAnalogous entries must be included in the configuration files of\nhost2\n.\nAdd TSIG keys for any ACLs (access control lists, not to be confused with\n   file system ACLs) that are defined for IP addresses and address ranges to\n   enable transaction security. The corresponding entry could look like this:\nallow-update { key host1-host2. ;};\nThis topic is discussed in more detail in the\nBIND Administrator\n   Reference Manual\nunder\nupdate-policy\n.\n39.9\nDNS security\n#\nDNSSEC, or DNS security, is described in RFC 2535. The tools available\n   for DNSSEC are discussed in the BIND Manual.\nA zone considered secure must have one or several zone keys associated with\n   it. These are generated with\ndnssec-keygen\n, as are the\n   host keys. The DSA encryption algorithm is currently used to generate these\n   keys. The public keys generated should be included in the corresponding zone\n   file with an\n$INCLUDE\nrule.\nWith the command\ndnssec-signzone\n, you can create sets of\n   generated keys (\nkeyset-\nfiles), transfer them to the\n   parent zone in a secure manner, and sign them. This generates the files to\n   include for each zone in\n/etc/named.conf\n.\n39.10\nMore information\n#\nFor more information, see the\nBIND Administrator Reference\n   Manual\nfrom the\nbind-doc\npackage, which is\n   installed under\n/usr/share/doc/packages/bind/arm\n.\n   Consider additionally consulting the RFCs referenced by the manual and the\n   manual pages included with BIND.\n/usr/share/doc/packages/bind/README.SUSE\ncontains\n   up-to-date information about BIND in\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n.\nOn this page\n39.1\nDNS terminology\n39.2\nInstallation\n39.3\nConfiguration with YaST\n39.4\nStarting the BIND name server\n39.5\nThe /etc/named.conf configuration file\n39.6\nZone files\n39.7\nDynamic update of zone data\n39.8\nSecure transactions\n39.9\nDNS security\n39.10\nMore information\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

A host configured to use\n    DHCP does not have control over its own static address. It is enabled to\n    configure itself completely and automatically according to directions from\n    the server. If you use the NetworkManager on the client side, you do not need to\n    configure the client. This is useful if you have changing environments and\n    only one interface active at a time. Never use NetworkManager on a machine that runs\n    a DHCP server.\nTip: IBM Z: DHCP support\nOn IBM Z platforms, DHCP only works on interfaces using the OSA and\n   OSA Express network cards. These cards are the only ones with a MAC, which\n   is required for the DHCP autoconfiguration features.\nOne way to configure a DHCP server is to identify each client using the\n  hardware address of its network card (which should usually be fixed),\n  then supply that client with identical settings each time it connects to the\n  server. DHCP can also be configured to assign addresses to each relevant\n  client dynamically from an address pool set up for this purpose. In the\n  latter case, the DHCP server tries to assign the same address to the client\n  each time it receives a request, even over extended periods. This works only\n  if the network does not have more clients than addresses.\nDHCP makes life easier for system administrators. Any changes, even bigger\n  ones, related to addresses and the network configuration in general can be\n  implemented centrally by editing the server's configuration file. This is\n  much more convenient than reconfiguring numerous workstations. It is also\n  much easier to integrate machines, particularly new machines, into the\n  network, because they can be given an IP address from the pool. Retrieving\n  the appropriate network settings from a DHCP server is especially useful in\n  case of laptops regularly used in different networks.\nIn this chapter, the DHCP server will run in the same subnet as the\n  workstations,\n192.168.2.0/24\nwith\n192.168.2.1\nas gateway. It has\n  the fixed IP address\n192.168.2.254\nand\n  serves two address ranges,\n192.168.2.10\nto\n192.168.2.20\nand\n192.168.2.100\nto\n192.168.2.200\n.\nA DHCP server supplies not only the IP address and the netmask, but also the\n  host name, domain name, gateway, and name server addresses for the client to\n  use. In addition to that, DHCP allows several parameters to be\n  configured in a centralized way, for example, a time server from which\n  clients may poll the current time or even a print server.\n40.1\nConfiguring a DHCP server with YaST\n#\nTo install a DHCP server, start YaST and select\nSoftware\n›\nSoftware\n   Management\n. Choose\nFilter\n›\nPatterns\nand select\nDHCP and DNS\n   Server\n. Confirm the installation of the dependent packages to\n   finish the installation process.\nImportant: LDAP support\nThe YaST DHCP module can be set up to store the server configuration\n    locally (on the host that runs the DHCP server) or to have its\n    configuration data managed by an LDAP server. To use LDAP, set\n    up your LDAP environment before configuring the DHCP server.\nFor more information about LDAP, see\nChapter 5,\nLDAP with 389 Directory Server\n.\nThe YaST DHCP module (\nyast2-dhcp-server\n) allows\n   you to set up your own DHCP server for the local network. The module can run\n   in wizard mode or expert configuration mode.\n40.1.1\nInitial configuration (wizard)\n#\nWhen the module is started for the first time, a wizard starts, prompting\n    you to make a few basic decisions concerning server administration.\n    Completing this initial setup produces a very basic server configuration\n    that should function in its essential aspects. The expert mode can be used\n    to deal with more advanced configuration tasks. Proceed as follows:\nSelect the interface from the list to which the DHCP server should listen\n      and click\nSelect\nand then\nNext\n. See\nFigure 40.1, “DHCP server: card selection”\n.\nNote: DHCP and\nfirewalld\nThe option\nOpen Firewall for Selected\n       Interfaces\ndoes not (yet) support\nfirewalld\nin\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n15 SP4\n. To manually open the DHCP port, run\n>\nsudo\nfirewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-service=dhcp\n>\nsudo\nfirewall-cmd --reload\nFigure 40.1:\nDHCP server: card selection\n#\nUse the check box to determine whether your DHCP settings should be\n      automatically stored by an LDAP server. In the text boxes, provide the\n      network specifics for all clients the DHCP server should manage. These\n      specifics are the domain name, address of a time server, addresses of the\n      primary and secondary name server, addresses of a print and a WINS server\n      (for a mixed network with both Windows and Linux clients), gateway\n      address, and lease time. See\nFigure 40.2, “DHCP server: global settings”\n.\nFigure 40.2:\nDHCP server: global settings\n#\nConfigure how dynamic IP addresses should be assigned to clients. To do\n      so, specify an IP range from which the server can assign addresses to\n      DHCP clients. All these addresses must be covered by the same netmask.\n      Also specify the lease time during which a client may keep its IP address\n      without needing to request an extension of the lease. Optionally, specify\n      the maximum lease time—the period during which the server reserves\n      an IP address for a particular client. See\nFigure 40.3, “DHCP server: dynamic DHCP”\n.\nFigure 40.3:\nDHCP server: dynamic DHCP\n#\nDefine how the DHCP server should be started. Specify whether to start\n      the DHCP server automatically when the system is booted or manually when\n      needed (for example, for testing purposes). Click\nFinish\nto complete the configuration of the server.\n      See\nFigure 40.4, “DHCP server: start-up”\n.\nFigure 40.4:\nDHCP server: start-up\n#\nInstead of using dynamic DHCP in the way described in the preceding\n      steps, you can also configure the server to assign addresses in\n      quasi-static fashion. Use the text boxes provided in the lower part to\n      specify a list of the clients to manage in this way. Specifically,\n      provide the\nName\nand the\nIP Address\nto give to such a client, the\nHardware Address\n, and\n      the\nNetwork Type\n(token ring or Ethernet). Modify the\n      list of clients, which is shown in the upper part with\nAdd\n,\nEdit\n, and\nDelete from\n      List\n. See\nFigure 40.5, “DHCP server: host management”\n.\nFigure 40.5:\nDHCP server: host management\n#\n40.1.2\nDHCP server configuration (expert)\n#\nIn addition to the configuration method discussed earlier, there is also an\n    expert configuration mode that allows you to change the DHCP server setup\n    in every detail. Start the expert configuration by clicking\nDHCP\n    Server Expert Configuration\nin the\nStart-Up\ndialog (see\nFigure 40.4, “DHCP server: start-up”\n).\nChroot environment and declarations\nIn this first dialog, make the existing configuration editable by\n       selecting\nStart DHCP Server\n. An important feature of\n       the behavior of the DHCP server is its ability to run in a chroot\n       environment, or chroot jail, to secure the server host. If the DHCP\n       server should ever be compromised by an outside attack, the attacker\n       will still be in the chroot jail, which prevents them from\n       accessing the rest of the system. The lower part of the dialog displays a\n       tree view with the declarations that have already been defined. Modify\n       these with\nAdd\n,\nDelete\n, and\nEdit\n. Selecting\nAdvanced\ntakes you\n       to additional expert dialogs. See\nFigure 40.6, “DHCP server: chroot jail and declarations”\n. After selecting\nAdd\n, define the type of declaration to add. With\nAdvanced\n, view the log file of the server, configure\n       TSIG key management, and adjust the configuration of the firewall\n       according to the setup of the DHCP server.\nFigure 40.6:\nDHCP server: chroot jail and declarations\n#\nSelecting the declaration type\nThe\nGlobal Options\nof the DHCP server are made up of\n       several declarations. This dialog lets you set the declaration types\nSubnet\n,\nHost\n,\nShared\n       Network\n,\nGroup\n,\nPool of\n       Addresses\n, and\nClass\n. This example shows\n       the selection of a new subnet (see\nFigure 40.7, “DHCP server: selecting a declaration type”\n).\nFigure 40.7:\nDHCP server: selecting a declaration type\n#\nSubnet configuration\nThis dialog allows you specify a new subnet with its IP address and\n       netmask. In the middle part of the dialog, modify the DHCP server start\n       options for the selected subnet using\nAdd\n,\nEdit\n, and\nDelete\n. To set up\n       dynamic DNS for the subnet, select\nDynamic DNS\n.\nFigure 40.8:\nDHCP server: configuring subnets\n#\nTSIG key management\nIf you chose to configure dynamic DNS in the previous dialog, you can\n       now configure the key management for a secure zone transfer. Selecting\nOK\ntakes you to another dialog in which to configure\n       the interface for dynamic DNS (see\nFigure 40.10, “DHCP server: interface configuration for dynamic DNS”\n).\nFigure 40.9:\nDHCP server: TSIG configuration\n#\nDynamic DNS: interface configuration\nYou can now activate dynamic DNS for the subnet by selecting\nEnable Dynamic DNS for This Subnet\n. After doing so,\n       use the drop-down box to activate the TSIG keys for forward and reverse\n       zones, making sure that the keys are the same for the DNS and the DHCP\n       server. With\nUpdate Global Dynamic DNS Settings\n,\n       enable the automatic update and adjustment of the global DHCP server\n       settings according to the dynamic DNS environment. Finally, define which\n       forward and reverse zones should be updated per dynamic DNS, specifying\n       the name of the primary name server for each of the two zones. Selecting\nOK\nreturns to the subnet configuration dialog (see\nFigure 40.8, “DHCP server: configuring subnets”\n). Selecting\nOK\nagain returns to the original expert configuration dialog.\nFigure 40.10:\nDHCP server: interface configuration for dynamic DNS\n#\nNote:\nignore client-updates\noption\nWhen enabling Dynamic DNS for a zone, YaST automatically adds the\nignore client-updates\noption to improve client\n      compatibility. The option can be disabled if it is not required.\nNetwork interface configuration\nTo define the interfaces the DHCP server should listen to and to adjust\n       the firewall configuration, select\nAdvanced\n›\nInterface Configuration\nfrom the expert configuration dialog. From the list of\n       interfaces displayed, select one or more that should be attended by the\n       DHCP server. If clients in all subnets need to be able to communicate\n       with the server and the server host also runs a firewall, adjust the\n       firewall accordingly.\nNote: DHCP and\nfirewalld\nThe option\nOpen Firewall for Selected\n         Interfaces\ndoes not (yet) support\nfirewalld\nin\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n15 SP4\n. To manually open the DHCP port, run\n>\nsudo\nfirewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-service=dhcp\n>\nsudo\nfirewall-cmd --reload\nFigure 40.11:\nDHCP server: network interface and firewall\n#\nAfter completing all configuration steps, close the dialog with\nOK\n. The server is now started with its new\n    configuration.\n40.2\nDHCP software packages\n#\nBoth the DHCP server and the DHCP clients are available for\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n. The DHCP server available is\ndhcpd\n(published by the Internet Systems\n   Consortium).\n\n   On the client side, there is\ndhcp-client\n(also from\n   ISC) and tools coming with the\nwicked\npackage.\nBy default, the\nwicked\ntools are installed with the\n   services\nwickedd-dhcp4\nand\nwickedd-dhcp6\n. Both are launched automatically on\n   each system boot to watch for a DHCP server. They do not need a\n   configuration file to do their job and work out of the box in most standard\n   setups. For more complex situations, use the ISC\ndhcp-client\n, which is controlled by means of the\n   configuration files\n/etc/dhclient.conf\nand\n/etc/dhclient6.conf\n.\n40.3\nThe DHCP server dhcpd\n#\nThe core of any DHCP system is the dynamic host configuration protocol\n   daemon. This server\nleases\naddresses and watches how\n   they are used, according to the settings defined in the configuration file\n/etc/dhcpd.conf\n. By changing the parameters and values\n   in this file, a system administrator can influence the program's behavior in\n   numerous ways. Look at the basic sample\n/etc/dhcpd.conf\nfile in\nExample 40.1, “The configuration file /etc/dhcpd.conf”\n.\nExample 40.1:\nThe configuration file /etc/dhcpd.conf\n#\ndefault-lease-time 600;         # 10 minutes\nmax-lease-time 7200;            # 2  hours\n\noption domain-name \"example.com\";\noption domain-name-servers 192.168.1.116;\noption broadcast-address 192.168.2.255;\noption routers 192.168.2.1;\noption subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;\n\nsubnet 192.168.2.0 netmask 255.255.255.0\n {\n  range 192.168.2.10 192.168.2.20;\n  range 192.168.2.100 192.168.2.200;\n }\nThis simple configuration file should be sufficient to get the DHCP server\n   to assign IP addresses in the network. Make sure that a semicolon is\n   inserted at the end of each line, because otherwise dhcpd is not started.\nThe sample file can be divided into three sections. The first one defines\n   how many seconds an IP address is leased to a requesting client by default\n   (\ndefault-lease-time\n) before it should apply for renewal.\n   This section also includes a statement of the maximum period for which a\n   machine may keep an IP address assigned by the DHCP server without applying\n   for renewal (\nmax-lease-time\n).\nIn the second part, some basic network parameters are defined on a global\n   level:\nThe line\noption domain-name\ndefines the default domain\n     of your network.\nWith the entry\noption domain-name-servers\n, specify up\n     to three values for the DNS servers used to resolve IP addresses into host\n     names and vice versa. Ideally, configure a name server on your machine or\n     somewhere else in your network before setting up DHCP. That name server\n     should also define a host name for each dynamic address and vice versa. To\n     learn how to configure your own name server, read\nChapter 39,\nThe domain name system\n.\nThe line\noption broadcast-address\ndefines the broadcast\n     address the requesting client should use.\nWith\noption routers\n, set where the server should send\n     data packets that cannot be delivered to a host on the local network\n     (according to the source and target host address and the subnet mask\n     provided). Usually, especially in smaller networks, this router is\n     identical to the Internet gateway.\nWith\noption subnet-mask\n, specify the netmask assigned\n     to clients.\nThe last section of the file defines a network, including a subnet mask. To\n   finish, specify the address range that the DHCP daemon should use to assign\n   IP addresses to interested clients. In\nExample 40.1, “The configuration file /etc/dhcpd.conf”\n,\n   clients may be given any address between\n192.168.2.10\nand\n192.168.2.20\nor\n192.168.2.100\nand\n192.168.2.200\n.\nAfter editing these few lines, you should be able to activate the DHCP\n   daemon with the command\nsystemctl start dhcpd\n. It will be\n   ready for use immediately. Use the command\nrcdhcpd\ncheck-syntax\nto perform a brief syntax check. If you encounter any unexpected problems\n   with your configuration (the server aborts with an error or does not return\ndone\non start), you should be able to find out what has\n   gone wrong by looking for information either in the main system log that can\n   be queried with the command\njournalctl\n(see\nChapter 21,\njournalctl\n: Query the\nsystemd\njournal\nfor more information).\nOn a default\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nsystem, the DHCP daemon is started in a chroot\n   environment for security reasons. The configuration files must be copied to\n   the chroot environment so the daemon can find them. Normally, there is no\n   need to worry about this because the command\nsystemctl start dhcpd\nautomatically copies the files.\n40.3.1\nClients with fixed IP addresses\n#\nDHCP can also be used to assign a predefined, static address to a specific\n    client. Addresses assigned explicitly always take priority over dynamic\n    addresses from the pool. A static address never expires in the way a\n    dynamic address would, for example, if there were not enough addresses\n    available and the server needed to redistribute them among clients.\nTo identify a client configured with a static address, dhcpd uses the\n    hardware address (which is a globally unique, fixed numerical code\n    consisting of six octet pairs) for the identification of all network\n    devices (for example,\n00:30:6E:08:EC:80\n). If the respective\n    lines, like the ones in\nExample 40.2, “Additions to the configuration file”\n, are added to\n    the configuration file of\nExample 40.1, “The configuration file /etc/dhcpd.conf”\n, the DHCP daemon\n    always assigns the same set of data to the corresponding client.\nExample 40.2:\nAdditions to the configuration file\n#\nhost jupiter {\nhardware ethernet 00:30:6E:08:EC:80;\nfixed-address 192.168.2.100;\n}\nThe name of the respective client (\nhost\nHOSTNAME\n, here\njupiter\n)\n    is entered in the first line and the MAC address in the second line. On\n    Linux hosts, find the MAC address with the command\nip\nlink show\nfollowed by the network device (for example,\neth0\n). The output should contain something like\nlink/ether 00:30:6E:08:EC:80\nIn the preceding example, a client with a network card having the MAC\n    address\n00:30:6E:08:EC:80\nis assigned the IP address\n192.168.2.100\nand the host name\njupiter\nautomatically. The type of hardware to enter is\nethernet\nin nearly all cases, although\ntoken-ring\n, which is often found on IBM systems, is also\n    supported.\n40.3.2\nThe\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nversion\n#\nTo improve security, the\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nversion of the ISC's DHCP server\n    comes with the non-root/chroot patch by Ari Edelkind applied. This enables\n    dhcpd to run with the user ID\nnobody\nand run in a chroot\n    environment (\n/var/lib/dhcp\n). To make this possible,\n    the configuration file\ndhcpd.conf\nmust be located in\n/var/lib/dhcp/etc\n. The init script automatically\n    copies the file to this directory when starting.\nControl the server's behavior regarding this feature by means of entries in\n    the file\n/etc/sysconfig/dhcpd\n. To run dhcpd without\n    the chroot environment, set the variable\nDHCPD_RUN_CHROOTED\nin\n/etc/sysconfig/dhcpd\nto\n“\nno\n”\n.\nTo enable dhcpd to resolve host names even from within the chroot\n    environment, some other configuration files must be copied as well:\n/etc/localtime\n/etc/host.conf\n/etc/hosts\n/var/run/netconfig/resolv.conf\nThese files are copied to\n/var/lib/dhcp/etc/\nwhen\n    starting the init script. Take these copies into account for any changes\n    that they require if they are dynamically modified by scripts like\n/etc/ppp/ip-up\n. However, there should be no need to\n    worry about this if the configuration file only specifies IP addresses\n    (instead of host names).\nIf your configuration includes additional files that should be copied into\n    the chroot environment, set these under the variable\nDHCPD_CONF_INCLUDE_FILES\nin the file\n/etc/sysconfig/dhcpd\n. To ensure that the DHCP logging\n    facility keeps working even after a restart of the syslog daemon, there is\n    an additional entry\nSYSLOGD_ADDITIONAL_SOCKET_DHCP\nin the file\n/etc/sysconfig/syslog\n.\n40.4\nMore information\n#\nMore information about DHCP is available at the Web site of the\nInternet Systems Consortium\n(\nhttps://www.isc.org/dhcp/\n). Information is\n   also available in the\ndhcpd\n,\ndhcpd.conf\n,\ndhcpd.leases\n, and\ndhcp-options\nman pages.\nOn this page\n40.1\nConfiguring a DHCP server with YaST\n40.2\nDHCP software packages\n40.3\nThe DHCP server dhcpd\n40.4\nMore information\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

To make\n    it easier to configure such services on a network client, the\n“\nservice location protocol\n”\n(SLP) was developed. SLP makes the\n    availability and configuration data of selected services known to all\n    clients in the local network. Applications that support SLP can use this\n    information to be configured automatically.\nSUSE® Linux Enterprise Server\nsupports installation using installation sources provided\n  with SLP and contains many system services with integrated support for SLP.\n  You can use SLP to provide networked clients with central functions, such as\n  an installation server, file server, or print server on your system. Services\n  that offer SLP support include cupsd, login, ntp, openldap2-client, postfix,\n  rpasswd, rsyncd, saned, sshd (via fish), vnc, and ypserv.\nAll packages necessary to use SLP services on a network client are installed\n  by default. However, if you want to\nprovide\nservices via\n  SLP, check that the\nopenslp-server\npackage is\n  installed.\n41.1\nThe SLP front-end\nslptool\n#\nslptool\nis a command line tool to query and register SLP\n   services. The query functions are useful for diagnostic purposes.

Like most\n   system services in\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n,\nslpd\nis controlled by means of a\n   separate start script. After the installation, the daemon is inactive by\n   default. To activate it for the current session, run\nsudo systemctl\n   start slpd\n. If\nslpd\nshould\n   be activated on system start-up, run\nsudo systemctl enable\n   slpd\n.\nMany applications in\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nhave integrated SLP support via the\nlibslp\nlibrary. If a service has not been compiled with\n   SLP support, use one of the following methods to make it available via SLP:\nStatic registration with\n/etc/slp.reg.d\nCreate a separate registration file for each new service. The following\n      example registers a scanner service:\n## Register a saned service on this system\n## en means english language\n## 65535 disables the timeout, so the service registration does\n## not need refreshes\nservice:scanner.sane://$HOSTNAME:6566,en,65535\nwatch-port-tcp=6566\ndescription=SANE scanner daemon\nThe most important line in this file is the\nservice\n      URL\n, which begins with\nservice:\n. This\n      contains the service type (\nscanner.sane\n) and the\n      address under which the service is available on the server.\n$HOSTNAME\nis automatically replaced with the\n      full host name. The name of the TCP port on which the relevant service\n      can be found follows, separated by a colon. Then enter the language in\n      which the service should appear and the duration of registration in\n      seconds. These should be separated from the service URL by commas. Set\n      the value for the duration of registration between\n0\nand\n65535\n.\n0\nprevents registration.\n65535\nremoves all restrictions.\nThe registration file also contains the two variables\nwatch-port-tcp\nand\ndescription\n.\nwatch-port-tcp\nlinks the SLP service\n      announcement to whether the relevant service is active by having\nslpd\ncheck the status of the\n      service. The second variable contains a more precise description of the\n      service that is displayed in suitable browsers.\nTip: YaST and SLP\nSome services brokered by YaST, such as an installation server or YOU\n       server, perform this registration automatically when you activate SLP in\n       the module dialogs. YaST then creates registration files for these\n       services.\nStatic registration with\n/etc/slp.reg\nThe only difference between this method and the procedure with\n/etc/slp.reg.d\nis that all services are grouped\n      within a central file.\nDynamic registration with\nslptool\nIf a service needs to be registered dynamically without the need of\n      configuration files, use the slptool command line utility. The same\n      utility can also be used to deregister an existing service offering\n      without restarting\nslpd\n. See\nSection 41.1, “The SLP front-end\nslptool\n”\nfor details.\n41.2.1\nSetting up an SLP installation server\n#\nAnnouncing the installation data via SLP within your network makes the\n    network installation much easier, since the installation data such as IP\n    address of the server or the path to the installation media are\n    automatically required via SLP query.\nRefer to\nChapter 16,\nSetting up a network installation source\nfor instructions.\n41.3\nMore information\n#\nRFC 2608, 2609, 2610\nRFC 2608 generally deals with the definition of SLP. RFC 2609 deals with\n      the syntax of the service URLs used in greater detail and RFC 2610 deals\n      with DHCP via SLP.\nhttp://www.openslp.org\nThe home page of the OpenSLP project.\n/usr/share/doc/packages/openslp\nThis directory contains the documentation for SLP coming with the\nopenslp-server\npackage, including a\nREADME.SUSE\ncontaining the\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\ndetails,\n      the RFCs, and two introductory HTML documents.

Developed by the\n    Apache Software Foundation\n    (\nhttp://www.apache.org/\n), it is available for\n    most operating systems.\nSUSE® Linux Enterprise Server\nincludes Apache version 2.4. This\n    chapter describes how to install, configure, and operate Apache. It also\n    shows how to use additional modules, such as SSL, and how to troubleshoot\n    Apache.\n42.1\nQuick start\n#\nThis section will help you quickly configure and start Apache.\n   You must be\nroot\nto install and configure Apache.\n42.1.1\nRequirements\n#\nMake sure the following requirements are met before trying to set up the\n    Apache Web server:\nThe machine's network is configured properly. For more information about\n      this topic, refer to\nChapter 23,\nBasic networking\n.\nThe machine's exact system time is maintained by synchronizing with a\n      time server. This is necessary because parts of the HTTP protocol depend\n      on the correct time. See\nChapter 38,\nTime synchronization with NTP\nto learn more about\n      this topic.\nThe latest security updates are installed. If in doubt, run a YaST\n      Online Update.\nThe default Web server port (\n80\n) is opened in the\n      firewall. For this, configure\nfirewalld\nto allow the service\nhttp\nin the public zone. See\nSection 23.4.3, “Configuring the firewall on the command line”\nfor details.\n42.1.2\nInstallation\n#\nApache on\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nis not installed by default. To install it with a\n    standard, predefined configuration that runs\n“\nout of the box\n”\n,\n    proceed as follows:\nProcedure 42.1:\nInstalling Apache with the default configuration\n#\nStart YaST and select\nSoftware\n›\nSoftware Management\n.\nChoose\nFilter\n›\nPatterns\nand select\nWeb and LAMP Server\n.\nConfirm the installation of the dependent packages to finish the\n      installation process.\n42.1.3\nStart\n#\nYou can start Apache automatically at boot time or start it manually.\nTo make sure that Apache is automatically started during boot in the\n    targets\nmulti-user.target\nand\ngraphical.target\n, execute the following command:\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl enable apache2.service\nFor more information about the\nsystemd\ntargets in\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nand a description of the YaST\nServices Manager\n, refer to\nSection 19.4, “Managing services with YaST”\n.\nTo manually start Apache using the shell, run\nsystemctl start\n    apache2.service\n.\nProcedure 42.2:\nChecking if Apache is running\n#\nIf you do not receive error messages when starting Apache, this usually\n     indicates that the Web server is running. To test this:\nStart a browser and open\nhttp://localhost/\n.\nIf Apache is up and running, you get a test page stating\n“\nIt\n      works!\n”\n.\nIf you do not see this page, refer to\nSection 42.9, “Troubleshooting”\n.\nNow that the Web server is running, you can add your own documents, adjust\n    the configuration according to your needs, or add functionality by\n    installing modules.\n42.2\nConfiguring Apache\n#\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\noffers two configuration options:\nConfiguring Apache manually\nConfiguring Apache with YaST\nManual configuration offers a higher level of detail, but lacks the\n   convenience of the YaST GUI.\nImportant: Reload or restart Apache after configuration changes\nMost configuration changes require a reload (some also a restart) of Apache\n    to take effect. Manually reload Apache with\nsystemctl reload\n    apache2.service\nor use one of the restart options as described in\nSection 42.3, “Starting and stopping Apache”\n.\nIf you configure Apache with YaST, this can be taken care of\n    automatically if you set\nHTTP Service\nto\nEnabled\nas described in\nSection 42.2.3.2, “HTTP server configuration”\n.\n42.2.1\nApache configuration files\n#\nThis section gives an overview of the Apache configuration files. If you\n    use YaST for configuration, you do not need to touch these\n    files—however, the information might be useful for you to switch to\n    manual configuration later on.\nApache configuration files can be found in two different locations:\n/etc/sysconfig/apache2\n/etc/apache2/\n42.2.1.1\n/etc/sysconfig/apache2\n#\n/etc/sysconfig/apache2\ncontrols some global settings\n     of Apache, like modules to load, additional configuration files to\n     include, flags with which the server should be started, and flags that\n     should be added to the command line. Every configuration option in this\n     file is extensively documented and therefore not mentioned here. For a\n     general-purpose Web server, the settings in\n/etc/sysconfig/apache2\nshould be sufficient for any\n     configuration needs.\n42.2.1.2\n/etc/apache2/\n#\n/etc/apache2/\nhosts all configuration files for\n     Apache. In the following, the purpose of each file is explained. Each file\n     includes several configuration options (also called\ndirectives\n). Every configuration option in these\n     files is extensively documented and therefore not mentioned here.\nThe Apache configuration files are organized as follows:\n/etc/apache2/\n     |\n     |- charset.conv\n     |- conf.d/\n     |   |\n     |   |- *.conf\n     |\n     |- default-server.conf\n     |- errors.conf\n     |- global.conf\n     |- httpd.conf\n     |- listen.conf\n     |- loadmodule.conf\n     |- magic\n     |- mime.types\n     |- mod_*.conf\n     |- protocols.conf\n     |- server-tuning.conf\n     |- ssl-global.conf\n     |- ssl.*\n     |- sysconfig.d\n     |   |\n     |   |- global.conf\n     |   |- include.conf\n     |   |- loadmodule.conf . .\n     |\n     |- uid.conf\n     |- vhosts.d\n     |   |- *.conf\nApache configuration files in /etc/apache2/\n#\ncharset.conv\nSpecifies which character sets to use for different languages. Do not\n        edit this file.\nconf.d/*.conf\nConfiguration files added by other modules. These configuration files\n        can be included into your virtual host configuration where needed. See\nvhosts.d/vhost.template\nfor examples. By doing so,\n        you can provide different module sets for different virtual hosts.\ndefault-server.conf\nGlobal configuration for all virtual hosts with reasonable defaults.\n        Instead of changing the values, overwrite them with a virtual host\n        configuration.\nerrors.conf\nDefines how Apache responds to errors. To customize these messages for\n        all virtual hosts, edit this file. Otherwise overwrite these directives\n        in your virtual host configurations.\nglobal.conf\nGeneral configuration of the main Web server process, such as the access\n        path, error logs, or the level of logging.\nhttpd.conf\nThe main Apache server configuration file. Avoid changing this file. It\n        primarily contains include statements and global settings. Overwrite\n        global settings in the pertinent configuration files listed here.\n        Change host-specific settings (such as document root) in your virtual\n        host configuration.\nlisten.conf\nBinds Apache to specific IP addresses and ports. Name-based virtual\n        hosting is also configured here. For details, see\nSection 42.2.2.1.1, “Name-based virtual hosts”\n.\nmagic\nData for the mime_magic module that helps Apache automatically\n        determine the MIME type of an unknown file. Do not change this file.\nmime.types\nMIME types known by the system (this actually is a link to\n/etc/mime.types\n). Do not edit this file. If you\n        need to add MIME types not listed here, add them to\nmod_mime-defaults.conf\n.\nmod_*.conf\nConfiguration files for the modules that are installed by default.\n        Refer to\nSection 42.4, “Installing, activating, and configuring modules”\nfor details. Note that\n        configuration files for optional modules reside in the directory\nconf.d\n.\nprotocols.conf\nConfiguration directives for serving pages over HTTP2 connection.\nserver-tuning.conf\nContains configuration directives for the different MPMs (see\nSection 42.4.4, “Multiprocessing modules”\n) and general configuration\n        options that control Apache's performance. Properly test your Web\n        server when making changes here.\nssl-global.conf\nand\nssl.*\nGlobal SSL configuration and SSL certificate data. Refer to\nSection 42.6, “Setting up a secure Web server with SSL”\nfor details.\nsysconfig.d/*.conf\nConfiguration files automatically generated from\n/etc/sysconfig/apache2\n. Do not change any of these\n        files—edit\n/etc/sysconfig/apache2\ninstead.\n        Do not put other configuration files in this directory.\nuid.conf\nSpecifies under which user and group ID Apache runs. Do not change this\n        file.\nvhosts.d/*.conf\nYour virtual host configuration should be located here. The directory\n        contains template files for virtual hosts with and without SSL. Every\n        file in this directory ending with\n.conf\nis\n        automatically included in the Apache configuration. Refer to\nSection 42.2.2.1, “Virtual host configuration”\nfor details.\n42.2.2\nConfiguring Apache manually\n#\nConfiguring Apache manually involves editing plain text configuration files\n    as user\nroot\n.\n42.2.2.1\nVirtual host configuration\n#\nThe term\nvirtual host\nrefers to Apache's ability to\n     serve multiple universal resource identifiers (URIs) from the same\n     physical machine. This means that several domains, such as www.example.com and\n     www.example.net, are run by a single Web server on one physical machine.\nIt is common practice to use virtual hosts to save administrative effort\n     (only a single Web server needs to be maintained) and hardware expenses\n     (each domain does not require a dedicated server). Virtual hosts can be\n     name based, IP based, or port based.\nTo list all existing virtual hosts, use the command\napache2ctl\n-S\n. This outputs a list\n     showing the default server and all virtual hosts together with their IP\n     addresses and listening ports. Furthermore, the list also contains an\n     entry for each virtual host showing its location in the configuration\n     files.\nVirtual hosts can be configured via YaST as described in\nSection 42.2.3.1.4, “Virtual hosts”\nor\n     by manually editing a configuration file. By default, Apache in\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nis prepared for one configuration file per virtual host in\n/etc/apache2/vhosts.d/\n. All files in this directory\n     with the extension\n.conf\nare automatically included\n     to the configuration. A basic template for a virtual host is provided in\n     this directory (\nvhost.template\nor\nvhost-ssl.template\nfor a virtual host with SSL\n     support).\nTip: Always create a virtual host configuration\nIt is recommended to always create a virtual host configuration file,\n      even if your Web server only hosts one domain. By doing so, you not only\n      have the domain-specific configuration in one file, but you can always\n      fall back to a working basic configuration by simply moving, deleting, or\n      renaming the configuration file for the virtual host. For the same\n      reason, you should also create separate configuration files for each\n      virtual host.\nWhen using name-based virtual hosts it is recommended to set up a default\n      configuration that will be used when a domain name does not match a\n      virtual host configuration. The default virtual host is the one whose\n      configuration is loaded first. Since the order of the configuration files\n      is determined by file name, start the file name of the default virtual\n      host configuration with an underscore character (\n_\n) to\n      make sure it is loaded first (for example:\n_default_vhost.conf\n).\nThe\n<VirtualHost>\n</VirtualHost>\nblock holds the information that applies to a particular domain. When\n     Apache receives a client request for a defined virtual host, it uses the\n     directives enclosed in this section. Almost all directives can be used in\n     a virtual host context. See\nhttp://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/quickreference.html\nfor further information about Apache's configuration directives.\n42.2.2.1.1\nName-based virtual hosts\n#\nWith name-based virtual hosts, more than one Web site is served per IP\n      address. Apache uses the host field in the HTTP header that is sent by\n      the client to connect the request to a matching\nServerName\nentry of one of the virtual host\n      declarations. If no matching\nServerName\nis\n      found, the first specified virtual host is used as a default.\nThe first step is to create a\n<VirtualHost>\nblock for each different name-based host that you want to serve. Inside\n      each\n<VirtualHost>\nblock, you will need at\n      minimum a\nServerName\ndirective to designate which host\n      is served and a\nDocumentRoot\ndirective to show where\n      in the file system the content for that host resides.\nExample 42.1:\nBasic examples of name-based\nVirtualHost\nentries\n#\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n# This first-listed virtual host is also the default for *:80\nServerName www.example.com\nServerAlias example.com\nDocumentRoot /srv/www/htdocs/domain\n</VirtualHost>\n\n<VirtualHost *:80>\nServerName other.example.com\nDocumentRoot /srv/www/htdocs/otherdomain\n</VirtualHost>\nThe opening\nVirtualHost\ntag takes the IP address\n      (or fully qualified domain name) as an argument in a name-based virtual\n      host configuration. A port number directive is optional.\nThe wild card\n*\nis also allowed as a substitute for\n      the IP address. When using IPv6 addresses, the address must be included\n      in square brackets.\nExample 42.2:\nName-based\nVirtualHost\ndirectives\n#\n<VirtualHost 192.168.3.100:80>\n  ...\n</VirtualHost>\n\n<VirtualHost 192.168.3.100>\n  ...\n</VirtualHost>\n\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n  ...\n</VirtualHost>\n\n<VirtualHost *>\n  ...\n</VirtualHost>\n\n<VirtualHost [2002:c0a8:364::]>\n  ...\n</VirtualHost>\n42.2.2.1.2\nIP-based virtual hosts\n#\nThis alternative virtual host configuration requires the setup of\n      multiple IP addresses for a machine. One instance of Apache hosts several\n      domains, each of which is assigned a different IP.\nThe physical server must have one IP address for each IP-based virtual\n      host. If the machine does not have multiple network cards, virtual\n      network interfaces (IP aliasing) can also be used.\nThe following example shows Apache running on a machine with the IP\n192.168.3.100\n, hosting two domains\n      on the additional IP addresses\n192.168.3.101\nand\n192.168.3.102\n. A separate\nVirtualHost\nblock is needed for every virtual\n      server.\nExample 42.3:\nIP-based\nVirtualHost\ndirectives\n#\n<VirtualHost 192.168.3.101>\n  ...\n</VirtualHost>\n\n<VirtualHost 192.168.3.102>\n  ...\n</VirtualHost>\nHere,\nVirtualHost\ndirectives are only specified\n      for interfaces other than\n192.168.3.100\n. When a\nListen\ndirective is also configured for\n192.168.3.100\n, a separate IP-based virtual host must\n      be created to answer HTTP requests to that interface—otherwise the\n      directives found in the default server configuration\n      (\n/etc/apache2/default-server.conf\n) are applied.\n42.2.2.1.3\nBasic virtual host configuration\n#\nAt least the following directives should be in each virtual host\n      configuration to set up a virtual host. See\n/etc/apache2/vhosts.d/vhost.template\nfor more\n      options.\nServerName\nThe fully qualified domain name under which the host should be\n         addressed.\nDocumentRoot\nPath to the directory from which Apache should serve files for this\n         host. For security reasons, access to the entire file system is\n         forbidden by default, so you must explicitly unlock this directory\n         within a\nDirectory\ncontainer.\nServerAdmin\nE-mail address of the server administrator. This address is, for\n         example, shown on error pages Apache creates.\nErrorLog\nThe error log file for this virtual host. Although it is not necessary\n         to create separate error log files for each virtual host, it is common\n         practice to do so, because it makes the debugging of errors much\n         easier.\n/var/log/apache2/\nis the default\n         directory for Apache's log files.\nCustomLog\nThe access log file for this virtual host. Although it is not\n         necessary to create separate access log files for each virtual host,\n         it is common practice to do so, because it allows the separate\n         analysis of access statistics for each host.\n/var/log/apache2/\nis the default directory for\n         Apache's log files.\nAs mentioned above, access to the whole file system is forbidden by\n      default for security reasons. Therefore, explicitly unlock the\n      directories in which you have placed the files Apache should\n      serve—for example the\nDocumentRoot\n:\n<Directory \"/srv/www/www.example.com/htdocs\">\n  Require all granted\n</Directory>\nNote:\nRequire all granted\nIn previous versions of Apache, the statement\nRequire all\n       granted\nwas expressed as:\nOrder allow,deny\nAllow from all\nThis old syntax is still supported by the\nmod_access_compat\nmodule.\nThe complete configuration file looks like this:\nExample 42.4:\nBasic\nVirtualHost\nconfiguration\n#\n<VirtualHost 192.168.3.100>\n  ServerName www.example.com\n  DocumentRoot /srv/www/www.example.com/htdocs\n  ServerAdmin webmaster@example.com\n  ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/www.example.com_log\n  CustomLog /var/log/apache2/www.example.com-access_log common\n  <Directory \"/srv/www/www.example.com/htdocs\">\n  Require all granted\n  </Directory>\n</VirtualHost>\n42.2.3\nConfiguring Apache with YaST\n#\nTo configure your Web server with YaST, start YaST and select\nNetwork Services\n›\nHTTP\n  Server\n. When starting the module for the first time,\n  the\nHTTP Server Wizard\nstarts, prompting you to make a few\n  basic decisions concerning administration of the server. After having\n  finished the wizard, the\nHTTP Server Configuration\ndialog\n  starts each time you call the\nHTTP Server\nmodule. For more\n  information, see\nSection 42.2.3.2, “HTTP server configuration”\n.\n42.2.3.1\nHTTP server wizard\n#\nThe HTTP Server Wizard consists of five steps. In the last step of the\n   dialog, you may enter the expert configuration mode to make even more\n   specific settings.\n42.2.3.1.1\nNetwork device selection\n#\nHere, specify the network interfaces and ports Apache uses to listen for\n    incoming requests. You can select any combination of existing network\n    interfaces and their respective IP addresses. Ports from all three ranges\n    (well-known ports, registered ports, and dynamic or private ports) that are\n    not reserved by other services can be used. The default setting is to\n    listen on all network interfaces (IP addresses) on port\n80\n.\nCheck\nOpen Port In Firewall\nto open the ports in the\n    firewall that the Web server listens on. This is necessary to make the Web\n    server available on the network, which can be a LAN, WAN, or the public\n    Internet. Keeping the port closed is only useful in test situations where\n    no external access to the Web server is necessary. If you have multiple\n    network interfaces, click\nFirewall Details\nto specify on\n    which interface(s) the port(s) should be opened.\nClick\nNext\nto continue with the configuration.\n42.2.3.1.2\nModules\n#\nThe\nModules\nconfiguration option allows for the\n    activation or deactivation of the script languages that the Web server\n    should support. For the activation or deactivation of other modules, refer\n    to\nSection 42.2.3.2.2, “Server modules”\n.\n    Click\nNext\nto advance to the next dialog.\n42.2.3.1.3\nDefault host\n#\nThis option pertains to the default Web server. As explained in\nSection 42.2.2.1, “Virtual host configuration”\n, Apache can\n    serve multiple virtual hosts from a single physical machine. The first\n    declared virtual host in the configuration file is commonly called the\ndefault host\n. Each virtual host inherits the default\n    host's configuration.\nTo edit the host settings (also called\ndirectives\n),\n    select the appropriate entry in the table then click\nEdit\n. To add new directives, click\nAdd\n. To delete a directive, select it and click\nDelete\n.\nFigure 42.1:\nHTTP server wizard: default host\n#\nHere is list of the default settings of the server:\nDocument Root\nPath to the directory from which Apache serves files for this host.\n/srv/www/htdocs\nis the default location.\nAlias\nUsing\nAlias\ndirectives, URLs can be mapped to\n       physical file system locations. This means that a certain path even\n       outside the\nDocument Root\nin the file system can be\n       accessed via a URL aliasing that path.\nThe default\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nAlias\n/icons\npoints to\n/usr/share/apache2/icons\nfor the Apache icons\n       displayed in the directory index view.\nScriptAlias\nSimilar to the\nAlias\ndirective, the\nScriptAlias\ndirective maps a URL to a file\n       system location. The difference is that\nScriptAlias\ndesignates the target directory as\n       a CGI location, meaning that CGI scripts should be executed in that\n       location.\nDirectory\nWith\nDirectory\nsettings, you can enclose a\n       group of configuration options that will only apply to the specified\n       directory.\nAccess and display options for the directories\n/srv/www/htdocs\n,\n/usr/share/apache2/icons\nand\n/srv/www/cgi-bin\nare configured here. It should not\n       be necessary to change the defaults.\nInclude\nWith include, additional configuration files can be specified. Two\nInclude\ndirectives are already preconfigured:\n/etc/apache2/conf.d/\nis the directory containing\n       the configuration files that come with external modules. With this\n       directive, all files in this directory ending in\n.conf\nare included. With the second directive,\n/etc/apache2/conf.d/apache2-manual.conf\n, the\napache2-manual\nconfiguration file is included.\nServer Name\nThis specifies the default URL used by clients to contact the Web\n       server. Use a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) to reach the Web server\n       at\nhttp://\nFQDN\n/\nor its IP\n       address. You cannot choose an arbitrary name here—the server must\n       be\n“\nknown\n”\nunder this name.\nServer Administrator E-Mail\nE-mail address of the server administrator. This address is, for\n       example, shown on error pages Apache creates.\nAfter finishing with the\nDefault Host\nstep, click\nNext\nto continue with the configuration.\n42.2.3.1.4\nVirtual hosts\n#\nIn this step, the wizard displays a list of already configured virtual\n    hosts (see\nSection 42.2.2.1, “Virtual host configuration”\n). If\n    you have not made manual changes prior to starting the YaST HTTP wizard,\n    no virtual host is present.\nTo add a host, click\nAdd\nto open a dialog in which to\n    enter basic information about the host, such as\nServer\n    Name\n,\nServer Contents Root\n(\nDocumentRoot\n), and the\nAdministrator\n    E-Mail\n.\nServer Resolution\nis used to determine\n    how a host is identified (name based or IP based). Specify the name or IP\n    address with\nChange Virtual Host ID\nClicking\nNext\nadvances to the second part of the virtual\n    host configuration dialog.\nIn part two of the virtual host configuration you can specify whether to\n    enable CGI scripts and which directory to use for these scripts. It is also\n    possible to enable SSL. If you do so, you must specify the path to the\n    certificate as well. See\nSection 42.6.2, “Configuring Apache with SSL”\nfor details on SSL and certificates. With the\nDirectory\n    Index\noption, you can specify which file to display when the\n    client requests a directory (by default,\nindex.html\n).\n    Add one or more file names (space-separated) to change this. With\nEnable Public HTML\n, the content of the users public\n    directories\n    (\n~\nUSER\n/public_html/\n) is\n    made available on the server under\nhttp://www.example.com/~\nUSER\n.\nImportant: Creating virtual hosts\nIt is not possible to add virtual hosts at will. If using name-based\n     virtual hosts, each host name must be resolved on the network. If using\n     IP-based virtual hosts, you can assign only one host to each IP address\n     available.\n42.2.3.1.5\nSummary\n#\nThis is the final step of the wizard. Here, determine how and when the\n    Apache server is started: when booting or manually. Also see a short\n    summary of the configuration made so far. If you are satisfied with your\n    settings, click\nFinish\nto complete configuration. To\n    change something, click\nBack\nuntil you have reached the\n    desired dialog. Clicking\nHTTP Server Expert\n    Configuration\nopens the dialog described in\nSection 42.2.3.2, “HTTP server configuration”\n.\nFigure 42.2:\nHTTP server wizard: summary\n#\n42.2.3.2\nHTTP server configuration\n#\nThe\nHTTP Server Configuration\ndialog also lets you make\n   even more adjustments to the configuration than the wizard (which only runs\n   if you configure your Web server for the first time). It consists of four\n   tabs described in the following. No configuration option you change here is\n   effective immediately—you always must confirm your changes with\nFinish\nto make them effective. Clicking\nAbort\nleaves the configuration module and discards your\n   changes.\n42.2.3.2.1\nListen ports and addresses\n#\nIn\nHTTP Service\n, select whether Apache should be running\n    (\nEnabled\n) or stopped (\nDisabled\n). In\nListen on Ports\n,\nAdd\n,\nEdit\n, or\nDelete\naddresses and ports\n    on which the server should be available. The default is to listen on all\n    interfaces on port\n80\n. You should always check\nOpen Port In Firewall\n, because otherwise the Web server\n    is not reachable from outside. Keeping the port closed is only useful in\n    test situations where no external access to the Web server is necessary. If\n    you have multiple network interfaces, click\nFirewall\n    Details\nto specify on which interface(s) the port(s) should be\n    opened.\nWith\nLog Files\n, watch either the access log file or the\n    error log file. This is useful if you want to test your configuration. The\n    log file opens in a separate window from which you can also restart or\n    reload the Web server. For details, see\nSection 42.3, “Starting and stopping Apache”\n. These commands are effective\n    immediately and their log messages are also displayed immediately.\nFigure 42.3:\nHTTP server configuration: listen ports and addresses\n#\n42.2.3.2.2\nServer modules\n#\nYou can change the status (enabled or disabled) of Apache2 modules by\n    clicking\nToggle Status\n. Click\nAdd\n    Module\nto add a new module that is already installed but not yet\n    listed. Learn more about modules in\nSection 42.4, “Installing, activating, and configuring modules”\n.\nFigure 42.4:\nHTTP server configuration: server modules\n#\n42.2.3.2.3\nMain host or hosts\n#\nThese dialogs are identical to the ones already described. Refer to\nSection 42.2.3.1.3, “Default host”\nand\nSection 42.2.3.1.4, “Virtual hosts”\n.\n42.3\nStarting and stopping Apache\n#\nIf configured with YaST as described in\nSection 42.2.3, “Configuring Apache with YaST”\n, Apache is started at boot\n   time in the\nmulti-user.target\nand\ngraphical.target\n. You can change this behavior\n   using YaST's\nServices Manager\nor with the\nsystemctl\ncommand line tool (\nsystemctl\n   enable\nor\nsystemctl disable\n).\nTo start, stop, or manipulate Apache on a running system, use either the\nsystemctl\nor the\napachectl\ncommands as\n   described below.\nFor general information about\nsystemctl\ncommands, refer\n   to\nSection 19.2.1, “Managing services in a running system”\n.\nsystemctl status apache2.service\nChecks if Apache is started.\nsystemctl start apache2.service\nStarts Apache if it is not already running.\nsystemctl stop apache2.service\nStops Apache by terminating the parent process.\nsystemctl restart apache2.service\nStops and then restarts Apache. Starts the Web server if it was not\n      running before.\nsystemctl try-restart apache2.service\nStops then restarts Apache only if it is already running.\nsystemctl reload apache2.service\nStops the Web server by advising all forked Apache processes to first\n      finish their requests before shutting down. As each process dies, it is\n      replaced by a newly started one, resulting in a complete\n“\nrestart\n”\nof Apache.\nTip: Restarting Apache in production environments\nThis command allows activating changes in the Apache configuration\n       without causing connection break-offs.\nsystemctl stop apache2.service\nStops the Web server after a defined period of time configured with\nGracefulShutdownTimeout\nto ensure that existing\n      requests can be finished.\napachectl configtest\nChecks the syntax of the configuration files without affecting a running\n      Web server. Because this check is forced every time the server is\n      started, reloaded, or restarted, it is usually not necessary to run the\n      test explicitly (if a configuration error is found, the Web server is not\n      started, reloaded, or restarted).\napachectl status\nand\napachectl fullstatus\nDumps a short or full status screen, respectively. Requires the module\nmod_status\nto be enabled and a text-based\n      browser (such as\nlinks\nor\nw3m\n) to\n      be installed. In addition to that,\nSTATUS\nmust be\n      added to\nAPACHE_SERVER_FLAGS\nin the file\n/etc/sysconfig/apache2\n.\nTip: Additional flags\nIf you specify additional flags to the commands, these are passed through\n    to the Web server.\n42.4\nInstalling, activating, and configuring modules\n#\nThe Apache software is built in a modular fashion: all functionality except\n   some core tasks are handled by modules. This has progressed so far that even\n   HTTP is processed by a module (\nhttp_core\n).\nApache modules can be compiled into the Apache binary at build time or be\n   dynamically loaded at runtime. Refer to\nSection 42.4.2, “Activation and deactivation”\nfor details of how to load\n   modules dynamically.\nApache modules are organized into the following categories:\nBase modules\nBase modules are compiled into Apache by default. Apache in\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nhas only\nmod_so\n(needed to load other modules)\n      and\nhttp_core\ncompiled in. All others are\n      available as shared objects: rather than being included in the server\n      binary itself, they can be included at runtime.\nExtension modules\nIn general, modules labeled as extensions are included in the Apache\n      software package, but are usually not compiled into the server\n      statically. In\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n, they are available as shared objects that\n      can be loaded into Apache at runtime.\nExternal modules\nModules labeled external are not included in the official Apache\n      distribution. However,\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nprovides several of them.\nMultiprocessing modules (MPMs)\nMPMs are responsible for accepting and handling requests to the Web\n      server, representing the core of the Web server software.\n42.4.1\nModule installation\n#\nIf you have done a default installation as described in\nSection 42.1.2, “Installation”\n, the following\n    modules are already installed: all base and extension modules, the\n    multiprocessing module Prefork MPM, and the external module\nmod_python\n.\nYou can install additional external modules by starting YaST and choosing\nSoftware\n›\nSoftware\n    Management\n. Now choose\nView\n›\nSearch\nand search for\napache\n. Among other packages, the results\n    list contains all available external Apache modules.\n42.4.2\nActivation and deactivation\n#\nActivate or deactivate particular modules either manually or with YaST.\n    In YaST, script language modules (PHP 8 and Python) need to\n    be enabled or disabled with the module configuration described in\nSection 42.2.3.1, “HTTP server wizard”\n. All other modules\n    can be enabled or disabled as described in\nSection 42.2.3.2.2, “Server modules”\n.\nIf you prefer to activate or deactivate the modules manually, use the\n    commands\na2enmod\nMODULE\nor\na2dismod\nMODULE\n,\n    respectively.\na2enmod -l\noutputs a list of all currently\n    active modules.\nImportant: Including configuration files for external modules\nIf you have activated external modules manually, make sure to load their\n     configuration files in all virtual host configurations. Configuration\n     files for external modules are located under\n/etc/apache2/conf.d/\nand are loaded in\n/etc/apache2/default-server.conf\nby default. For more\n     fine-grained control you can comment out the inclusion in\n/etc/apache2/default-server.conf\nand add it to\n     specific virtual hosts only. See\n/etc/apache2/vhosts.d/vhost.template\nfor examples.\n42.4.3\nBase and extension modules\n#\nAll base and extension modules are described in detail in the Apache\n    documentation. Only a brief description of the most important modules is\n    available here. Refer to\nhttp://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/\nto learn details about each module.\nmod_actions\nProvides methods to execute a script whenever a certain MIME type (such\n       as\napplication/pdf\n), a file with a specific\n       extension (like\n.rpm\n), or a certain request method\n       (such as\nGET\n) is requested. This module is\n       enabled by default.\nmod_alias\nProvides\nAlias\nand\nRedirect\ndirectives with which you can map a\n       URL to a specific directory (\nAlias\n) or redirect\n       a requested URL to another location. This module is enabled by default.\nmod_auth*\nThe authentication modules provide different authentication methods:\n       basic authentication with\nmod_auth_basic\nor\n       digest authentication with\nmod_auth_digest\n.\nmod_auth_basic\nand\nmod_auth_digest\nmust be combined with an\n       authentication provider module,\nmod_authn_*\n(for example,\nmod_authn_file\nfor text\n       file–based authentication) and with an authorization module\nmod_authz_*\n(for example,\nmod_authz_user\nfor user authorization).\nMore information about this topic is available in the\nAuthentication HOWTO\nat\nhttp://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/auth.html\n.\nmod_auth_openidc\nmod_auth_openidc\nthe only certified way to use\n       OpenID Connect with the Apache HTTP server. (See\nhttps://openid.net/developers/certified/\n.)\nmod_autoindex\nAutoindex generates directory listings when no index file (for example,\nindex.html\n) is present. The look and feel of these\n       indexes is configurable. This module is enabled by default. However,\n       directory listings are disabled by default via the\nOptions\ndirective—overwrite this setting\n       in your virtual host configuration. The default configuration file for\n       this module is located at\n/etc/apache2/mod_autoindex-defaults.conf\n.\nmod_cgi\nmod_cgi\nis needed to execute CGI scripts. This\n       module is enabled by default.\nmod_deflate\nUsing this module, Apache can be configured to compress given file types\n       on the fly before delivering them.\nmod_dir\nmod_dir\nprovides the\nDirectoryIndex\ndirective with which you can\n       configure which files are automatically delivered when a directory is\n       requested (\nindex.html\nby default). It also provides\n       an automatic redirect to the correct URL when a directory request does\n       not contain a trailing slash. This module is enabled by default.\nmod_env\nControls the environment that is passed to CGI scripts or SSI pages.\n       Environment variables can be set or unset or passed from the shell that\n       invoked the\nhttpd\nprocess. This\n       module is enabled by default.\nmod_expires\nWith\nmod_expires\n, you can control how often\n       proxy and browser caches refresh your documents by sending an\nExpires\nheader. This module is enabled by\n       default.\nmod_http2\nWith\nmod_http2\n, Apache gains support for the\n       HTTP/2 protocol. It can be enabled by specifying\nProtocols h2\n       http/1.1\nin a\nVirtualHost\n.\nmod_include\nmod_include\nlets you use Server Side Includes\n       (SSI), which provide a basic functionality to generate HTML pages\n       dynamically. This module is enabled by default.\nmod_info\nProvides a comprehensive overview of the server configuration under\nhttp://localhost/server-info/\n. For security reasons, you should always\n       limit access to this URL. By default only\nlocalhost\nis allowed to\n       access this URL.\nmod_info\nis configured at\n/etc/apache2/mod_info.conf\n.\nmod_log_config\nWith this module, you can configure the look of the Apache log files.\n       This module is enabled by default.\nmod_mime\nThe mime module ensures that a file is delivered with the correct MIME\n       header based on the file name's extension (for example\ntext/html\nfor HTML documents). This module is\n       enabled by default.\nmod_negotiation\nNecessary for content negotiation. See\nhttp://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/content-negotiation.html\nfor more information. This module is enabled by default.\nmod_rewrite\nProvides the functionality of\nmod_alias\n, but\n       offers more features and flexibility. With\nmod_rewrite\n, you can redirect URLs based on\n       multiple rules, request headers, and more.\nmod_setenvif\nSets environment variables based on details of the client's request,\n       such as the browser string the client sends, or the client's IP address.\n       This module is enabled by default.\nmod_spelling\nmod_spelling\nattempts to automatically correct\n       typographical errors in URLs, such as capitalization errors.\nmod_ssl\nEnables encrypted connections between Web server and clients. See\nSection 42.6, “Setting up a secure Web server with SSL”\nfor details. This module is enabled by\n       default.\nmod_status\nProvides information on server activity and performance under\nhttp://localhost/server-status/\n. For security reasons, you should always\n       limit access to this URL. By default, only\nlocalhost\nis allowed to\n       access this URL.\nmod_status\nis configured at\n/etc/apache2/mod_status.conf\n.\nmod_suexec\nmod_suexec\nlets you run CGI scripts under a\n       different user and group. This module is enabled by default.\nmod_userdir\nEnables user-specific directories available under\n~\nUSER\n/\n. The\nUserDir\ndirective must be specified in the\n       configuration. This module is enabled by default.\n42.4.4\nMultiprocessing modules\n#\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nprovides two different multiprocessing modules (MPMs) for use\n    with Apache:\nPrefork MPM\nWorker MPM\n42.4.4.1\nPrefork MPM\n#\nThe prefork MPM implements a non-threaded, preforking Web server. It makes\n     the Web server behave similarly to Apache version 1.x. In this version it\n     isolates each request and handles it by forking a separate child process.\n     Thus problematic requests cannot affect others, avoiding a lockup of the\n     Web server.\nWhile providing stability with this process-based approach, the prefork\n     MPM consumes more system resources than its counterpart, the worker MPM.\n     The prefork MPM is considered the default MPM for Unix-based operating\n     systems.\nImportant: MPMs in this document\nThis document assumes Apache is used with the prefork MPM.\n42.4.4.2\nWorker MPM\n#\nThe worker MPM provides a multi-threaded Web server. A thread is a\n“\nlighter\n”\nform of a process. The advantage of a thread over a\n     process is its lower resource consumption. Instead of only forking child\n     processes, the worker MPM serves requests by using threads with server\n     processes. The preforked child processes are multi-threaded. This approach\n     makes Apache perform better by consuming fewer system resources than the\n     prefork MPM.\nOne major disadvantage is the stability of the worker MPM: if a thread\n     becomes corrupt, all threads of a process can be affected. In the worst\n     case, this may result in a server crash. Especially when using the Common\n     Gateway Interface (CGI) with Apache under heavy load, internal server\n     errors might occur because of threads being unable to communicate with\n     system resources. Another argument against using the worker MPM with\n     Apache is that not all available Apache modules are thread-safe and thus\n     cannot be used with the worker MPM.\nWarning: Using PHP modules with MPMs\nNot all available PHP modules are thread-safe. Using the worker MPM with\nmod_php\nis strongly discouraged.\n42.4.5\nExternal modules\n#\nFind a list of all external modules shipped with\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nhere. Find\n    the module's documentation in the listed directory.\nmod_apparmor\nAdds support to Apache to provide\nAppArmor\nconfinement to individual CGI\n       scripts handled by modules like\nmod_php8\n.\nPackage Name:\napache2-mod_apparmor\nMore Information:\nPart V, “Confining privileges with\nAppArmor\n”\nmod_php8\nPHP is a server-side, cross-platform HTML embedded scripting language.\nPackage Name:\napache2-mod_php8\nConfiguration File:\n/etc/apache2/conf.d/php8.conf\nmod_python\nmod_python\nallows embedding Python within the\n       Apache HTTP server for a considerable boost in performance and added\n       flexibility in designing Web-based applications.\nPackage Name:\napache2-mod_python\nMore Information:\n/usr/share/doc/packages/apache2-mod_python\nmod_security\nmod_security\nprovides a Web application\n       firewall to protect Web applications from a range of attacks. It also\n       enables HTTP traffic monitoring and real-time analysis.\nPackage Name:\napache2-mod_security2\nConfiguration File:\n/etc/apache2/conf.d/mod_security2.conf\nMore Information:\n/usr/share/doc/packages/apache2-mod_security2\nDocumentation:\nhttp://modsecurity.org/documentation/\n42.4.6\nCompilation\n#\nApache can be extended by advanced users by writing custom modules. To\n    develop modules for Apache or compile third-party modules, the package\napache2-devel\nis required along with the\n    corresponding development tools.\napache2-devel\nalso contains the\napxs2\ntools, which are necessary for\n    compiling additional modules for Apache.\napxs2\nenables the compilation and installation of\n    modules from source code (including the required changes to the\n    configuration files), which creates\ndynamic shared\n    objects\n(DSOs) that can be loaded into Apache at runtime.\nThe\napxs2\nbinaries are located under\n/usr/sbin\n:\n/usr/sbin/apxs2\n—suitable for building an\n      extension module that works with any MPM. The installation location is\n/usr/lib64/apache2\n.\n/usr/sbin/apxs2-prefork\n—suitable for prefork\n      MPM modules. The installation location is\n/usr/lib64/apache2-prefork\n.\n/usr/sbin/apxs2-worker\n—suitable for worker MPM\n      modules. The installation location is\n/usr/lib64/apache2-worker\n.\nInstall and activate a module from source code with the following commands:\n>\nsudo\ncd /path/to/module/source\n>\nsudo\napxs2 -cia\nMODULE\n.c\nwhere\n-c\ncompiles the module,\n-i\ninstalls\n    it, and\n-a\nactivates it. Other options of\napxs2\nare described in the\napxs2(1)\nman page.\n42.5\nEnabling CGI scripts\n#\nApache's Common Gateway Interface (CGI) lets you create dynamic content with\n   programs or scripts usually called CGI scripts. CGI scripts can be written\n   in any programming language. Usually, script languages such as PHP are used.\nTo enable Apache to deliver content created by CGI scripts,\nmod_cgi\nneeds to be activated.\nmod_alias\nis also needed. Both modules are enabled\n   by default. Refer to\nSection 42.4.2, “Activation and deactivation”\nfor\n   details on activating modules.\nWarning: CGI security\nAllowing the server to execute CGI scripts is a potential security hole.\n    Refer to\nSection 42.8, “Avoiding security problems”\nfor additional information.\n42.5.1\nApache configuration\n#\nIn\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n, the execution of CGI scripts is only allowed in the\n    directory\n/srv/www/cgi-bin/\n. This location is already\n    configured to execute CGI scripts. If you have created a virtual host\n    configuration (see\nSection 42.2.2.1, “Virtual host configuration”\n) and want to\n    place your scripts in a host-specific directory, you must unlock and\n    configure this directory.\nExample 42.5:\nVirtualHost CGI configuration\n#\nScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ \"/srv/www/www.example.com/cgi-bin/\"\n1\n<Directory \"/srv/www/www.example.com/cgi-bin/\">\n Options +ExecCGI\n2\nAddHandler cgi-script .cgi .pl\n3\nRequire all granted\n4\n</Directory>\n1\nTells Apache to handle all files within this directory as CGI scripts.\n2\nEnables CGI script execution\n3\nTells the server to treat files with the extensions .pl and .cgi as CGI\n       scripts. Adjust according to your needs.\n4\nThe\nRequire\ndirective controls the default\n       access state. In this case, access is granted to the specified directory\n       without limitation. For more information on authentication and\n       authorization, see\nhttp://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/auth.html\n.\n42.5.2\nRunning an example script\n#\nCGI programming differs from \"regular\" programming in that the CGI programs\n    and scripts must be preceded by a MIME-Type header such as\nContent-type: text/html\n. This header is sent to the\n    client, so it understands what kind of content it receives. Secondly, the\n    script's output must be something the client, usually a Web browser,\n    understands—HTML usually, or plain text or images, for example.\nA simple test script available under\n/usr/share/doc/packages/apache2/test-cgi\nis part of\n    the Apache package. It outputs the content of some environment variables as\n    plain text. Copy this script to either\n/srv/www/cgi-bin/\nor the script directory of your\n    virtual host (\n/srv/www/www.example.com/cgi-bin/\n) and name it\ntest.cgi\n. Edit the file to have\n#!/bin/sh\nas the first line.\nFiles accessible by the Web server should be owned by the user\nroot\n. For additional information\n    see\nSection 42.8, “Avoiding security problems”\n. Because the Web server runs\n    with a different user, the CGI scripts must be world-executable and\n    world-readable. Change into the CGI directory and use the command\nchmod 755 test.cgi\nto apply the proper permissions.\nNow call\nhttp://localhost/cgi-bin/test.cgi\nor\nhttp://www.example.com/cgi-bin/test.cgi\n. You should see the\n“\nCGI/1.0 test script report\n”\n.\n42.5.3\nCGI troubleshooting\n#\nIf you do not see the output of the test program but an error message\n    instead, check the following:\nCGI troubleshooting\n#\nHave you reloaded the server after having changed the\n      configuration?\nIf not, reload with\nsystemctl reload\n      apache2.service\n.\nIf you have configured your custom CGI directory, is it\n      configured properly?\nIf in doubt, try the script within the\n      default CGI directory\n/srv/www/cgi-bin/\nand call it\n      with\nhttp://localhost/cgi-bin/test.cgi\n.\nAre the file permissions correct?\nChange into the\n      CGI directory and execute\nls -l test.cgi\n. The output\n      should start with\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root\nMake sure that the script does not contain programming errors. If you\n      have not changed\ntest.cgi\n, this should not be the\n      case, but if you are using your own programs, always make sure that they\n      do not contain programming errors.\n42.6\nSetting up a secure Web server with SSL\n#\nWhenever sensitive data, such as credit card information, is transferred\n   between Web server and client, it is desirable to have a secure, encrypted\n   connection with authentication.\nmod_ssl\nprovides\n   strong encryption using the secure sockets layer (SSL) and transport layer\n   security (TLS) protocols for HTTP communication between a client and the Web\n   server. Using TLS/SSL, a private connection between Web server and client is\n   established. Data integrity is ensured and client and server can\n   authenticate each other.\nFor this purpose, the server sends an SSL certificate that holds information\n   proving the server's valid identity before any request to a URL is answered.\n   In turn, this guarantees that the server is the uniquely correct end point\n   for the communication. Additionally, the certificate generates an encrypted\n   connection between client and server that can transport information without\n   the risk of exposing sensitive, plain-text content.\nmod_ssl\ndoes not implement the TLS/SSL protocols\n   itself, but acts as an interface between Apache and an SSL library. In\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n, the OpenSSL library is used. OpenSSL is automatically\n   installed with Apache.\nThe most visible effect of using\nmod_ssl\nwith\n   Apache is that URLs are prefixed with\nhttps://\ninstead of\nhttp://\n.\n42.6.1\nCreating an SSL certificate\n#\nTo use TLS/SSL with the Web server, you need to create an SSL certificate.\n    This certificate is needed for the authorization between Web server and\n    client, so that each party can clearly identify the other party. To ensure\n    the integrity of the certificate, it must be signed by a party every user\n    trusts.\nThere are three types of certificates you can create: a\n“\ndummy\n”\ncertificate for testing purposes only, a self-signed\n    certificate for a defined circle of users that trust you, and a certificate\n    signed by an independent, publicly-known certificate authority (CA).\nCreating a certificate is a two step process. First, a private key for the\n    certificate authority is generated then the server certificate is signed\n    with this key.\nTip: More information\nTo learn more about concepts and definitions of TLS/SSL, refer to\nhttps://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/ssl/ssl_intro.html\n.\n42.6.1.1\nCreating a\n“\ndummy\n”\ncertificate\n#\nTo generate a dummy certificate, call the script\n/usr/bin/gensslcert\n. It creates or overwrites the files\n     listed below. Use\ngensslcert\n's optional switches to\n     fine-tune the certificate. Call\n/usr/bin/gensslcert\n-h\nfor more information.\n/etc/apache2/ssl.crt/ca.crt\n/etc/apache2/ssl.crt/server.crt\n/etc/apache2/ssl.key/server.key\n/etc/apache2/ssl.csr/server.csr\nA copy of\nca.crt\nis also placed at\n/srv/www/htdocs/CA.crt\nfor download.\nImportant: For testing purposes only\nA dummy certificate should never be used on a production system. Only use\n      it for testing purposes.\n42.6.1.2\nCreating a self-signed certificate\n#\nIf you are setting up a secure Web server for an intranet or for a defined\n     circle of users, it is probably sufficient if you sign a certificate with\n     your own certificate authority (CA). Note that visitors to such a site\n     will see a warning like\n“\nthis is an untrusted site\n”\n, as Web\n     browsers do not recognize self-signed certificates.\nImportant: Self-signed certificates\nOnly use a self-signed certificate on a Web server that is accessed by\n      people who know and trust you as a certificate authority. It is not\n      recommended to use such a certificate for a public shop, for example.\nFirst you need to generate a certificate signing request (CSR). You are\n     going to use\nopenssl\n, with\nPEM\nas\n     the certificate format. During this step, you will be asked for a\n     passphrase, and to answer several questions. Remember the passphrase you\n     enter as you will need it in the future.\n>\nsudo\nopenssl req -new > new.cert.csr\nGenerating a 1024 bit RSA private key\n..++++++\n.........++++++\nwriting new private key to 'privkey.pem'\nEnter PEM pass phrase:\n1\nVerifying - Enter PEM pass phrase:\n2\n-----\nYou are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated\ninto your certificate request.\nWhat you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.\nThere are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank\nFor some fields there will be a default value,\nIf you enter '.', the field will be left blank.\n-----\nCountry Name (2 letter code) [AU]:\n3\nState or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:\n4\nLocality Name (eg, city) []:\n5\nOrganization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:\n6\nOrganizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:\n7\nCommon Name (for example server FQDN, or YOUR name) []:\n8\nEmail Address []:\n9\nPlease enter the following 'extra' attributes\nto be sent with your certificate request\nA challenge password []:\n10\nAn optional company name []:\n11\n1\nFill in your passphrase.\n2\nFill it in once more (and remember it).\n3\nFill in your 2 letter country code, such as\nGB\nor\nCZ\n.\n4\nFill in the name of the state where you live.\n5\nFill in the city name, such as\nPrague\n.\n6\nFill in the name of the organization you work for.\n7\nFill in your organization unit, or leave blank if you have none.\n8\nFill in either the domain name of the server, or your first and last\n       name.\n9\nFill in your work e-mail address.\n10\nLeave the challenge password empty, otherwise you will need to enter it\n       every time you restart the Apache Web server.\n11\nFill in the optional company name, or leave blank.\nNow you can generate the certificate. You are going to use\nopenssl\nagain, and the format of the certificate is the\n     default\nPEM\n.\nProcedure 42.3:\nGenerating the certificate\n#\nExport the private part of the key to\nnew.cert.key\n.\n       You will be prompted for the passphrase you entered when creating the\n       certificate signing request (CSR).\n>\nsudo\nopenssl rsa -in privkey.pem -out new.cert.key\nGenerate the public part of the certificate according to the information\n       you filled out in the signing request. The\n-days\noption\n       specifies the length of time before the certificate expires. You can\n       revoke a certificate, or replace one before it expires.\n>\nsudo\nopenssl x509 -in new.cert.csr -out new.cert.cert -req \\\n-signkey new.cert.key -days 365\nCopy the certificate files to the relevant directories, so that the\n       Apache server can read them. Make sure that the private key\n/etc/apache2/ssl.key/server.key\nis not\n       world-readable, while the public PEM certificate\n/etc/apache2/ssl.crt/server.crt\nis.\n>\nsudo\ncp new.cert.cert /etc/apache2/ssl.crt/server.crt\n>\nsudo\ncp new.cert.key /etc/apache2/ssl.key/server.key\nTip: Public certificate location\nThe last step is to copy the public certificate file from\n/etc/apache2/ssl.crt/server.crt\nto a location where\n      your users can access it to incorporate it into the list of known and\n      trusted CAs in their Web browsers. Otherwise a browser complains that the\n      certificate was issued by an unknown authority.\n42.6.1.3\nGetting an officially signed certificate\n#\nThere are several official certificate authorities that sign your\n     certificates. The certificate is signed by a trustworthy third party, so\n     can be fully trusted. Publicly operating secure Web servers usually have\n     an officially signed certificate. A list of the most used Certificate\n     Authorities (CAs) is available at\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority#Providers\n.\nWhen requesting an officially signed certificate, you do not send a\n     certificate to the CA. Instead, issue a Certificate Signing Request\n\n     (CSR). To create a CSR, run the following command:\n>\nopenssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout newkey.pem -out newreq.pem\nYou are asked to enter a distinguished name. This requires you to answer a\n     few questions, such as country name or organization name. Enter valid\n     data—everything you enter here later shows up in the certificate and\n     is checked. You do not need to answer every question. If one does not\n     apply to you or you want to leave it blank, use\n“\n.\n”\n. Common\n     name is the name of the CA itself—choose a significant name, such as\nMy company\nCA. Last, a challenge password and\n     an alternative company name must be entered.\nFind the CSR in the directory from which you called the script. The file\n     is named\nnewreq.pem\n.\n42.6.2\nConfiguring Apache with SSL\n#\nThe default port for TLS/SSL requests on the Web server side is 443. There\n    is no conflict between a\n“\nregular\n”\nApache listening on port 80\n    and an TLS/SSL-enabled Apache listening on port 443. In fact, HTTP and\n    HTTPS can be run with the same Apache instance. Usually separate virtual\n    hosts are used to dispatch requests to port 80 and port 443 to separate\n    virtual servers.\nImportant: Firewall configuration\nDo not forget to open the firewall for SSL-enabled Apache on port 443.\n     This can be done with\nfirewalld\nas described in\nSection 23.4.3, “Configuring the firewall on the command line”\n.\nThe SSL module is enabled by default in the global server configuration. In\n    case it has been disabled on your host, activate it with the following\n    command:\na2enmod ssl\n. To finally enable SSL, the server\n    needs to be started with the flag\n“\nSSL\n”\n. To do so, call\na2enflag SSL\n(case-sensitive!). If you have chosen to\n    encrypt your server certificate with a password, you should also increase\n    the value for\nAPACHE_TIMEOUT\nin\n/etc/sysconfig/apache2\n, so you have enough time to\n    enter the passphrase when Apache starts. Restart the server to make these\n    changes active. A reload is not sufficient.\nThe virtual host configuration directory contains a template\n/etc/apache2/vhosts.d/vhost-ssl.template\nwith\n    SSL-specific directives that are extensively documented. Refer to\nSection 42.2.2.1, “Virtual host configuration”\nfor the general\n    virtual host configuration.\nTo get started, copy the template to\n/etc/apache2/vhosts.d/\nMYSSL-HOST\n.conf\nand edit it. Adjusting the values for the following directives should be\n    sufficient:\nDocumentRoot\nServerName\nServerAdmin\nErrorLog\nTransferLog\n42.6.2.1\nName-based virtual hosts and SSL\n#\nBy default it is not possible to run multiple SSL-enabled virtual hosts on\n     a server with only one IP address. Name-based virtual hosting requires\n     that Apache knows which server name has been requested. The problem with\n     SSL connections is, that such a request can only be read after the SSL\n     connection has already been established (by using the default virtual\n     host). As a result, users will receive a warning message stating that the\n     certificate does not match the server name.\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\ncomes with an extension to the SSL protocol called Server\n     Name Indication (SNI) addresses this issue by sending the name of the\n     virtual domain as part of the SSL negotiation. This enables the server to\n“\nswitch\n”\nto the correct virtual domain early and present the\n     browser the correct certificate.\nSNI is enabled by default on\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n. To enable Name-Based Virtual\n     Hosts for SSL, configure the server as described in\nSection 42.2.2.1.1, “Name-based virtual hosts”\n(note that you need to use port\n443\nrather than port\n80\nwith SSL).\nImportant: SNI browser support\nSNI must also be supported on the client side. However, SNI is supported\n      by most browsers, except for certain older browsers. For more\n      information, see\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication#Support\n.\nTo configure handling of non-SNI capable browsers, use the directive\nSSLStrictSNIVHostCheck\n. When set to\non\nin the server configuration, non-SNI capable\n      browser will be rejected for all virtual hosts. When set to\non\nwithin a\nVirtualHost\ndirective, access to this particular host will be rejected.\nWhen set to\noff\nin the server configuration, the\n      server will behave as if not having SNI support. SSL requests will be\n      handled by the\nfirst\nvirtual host defined (for port\n      443).\n42.7\nRunning multiple Apache instances on the same server\n#\nRunning multiple Apache instances on the same server has several advantages\n   over running multiple virtual hosts (see\nSection 42.2.2.1, “Virtual host configuration”\n):\nWhen a virtual host needs to be disabled for some time, you need to change\n     the Web server configuration and restart it so that the change takes\n     effect.\nIn case of problems with one virtual host, you need to restart all of\n     them.\nYou can run the default Apache instance as usual:\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl start apache2.service\nIt reads the default\n/etc/sysconfig/apache2\nfile. If\n   the file is not present, or it is present but it does not set the\nAPACHE_HTTPD_CONF\nvariable, it reads\n/etc/apache2/httpd.conf\n.\nTo activate another Apache instance, run:\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl start apache2@\nINSTANCE_NAME\nFor example:\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl start apache2@example_web.org\nBy default, the instance uses\n/etc/apache2@example_web.org/httpd.conf\nas a main\n   configuration file, which can be overwritten by setting\nAPACHE_HTTPD_CONF\nin\n/etc/sysconfig/apache2@example_web.org\n.\nAn example to set up an additional instance of Apache follows. Note that you\n   need to execute all the commands as\nroot\n.\nProcedure 42.4:\nConfiguring an additional Apache instance\n#\nCreate a new configuration file based on\n/etc/sysconfig/apache2\n, for example\n/etc/sysconfig/apache2@example_web.org\n:\n>\nsudo\ncp /etc/sysconfig/apache2 /etc/sysconfig/apache2@example_web.org\nEdit the file\n/etc/sysconfig/apache2@example_web.org\nand change the line containing\nAPACHE_HTTPD_CONF\nto\nAPACHE_HTTPD_CONF=\"/etc/apache2/httpd@example_web.org.conf\"\nCreate the file\n/etc/apache2/httpd@example_web.org.conf\nbased on\n/etc/apache2/httpd.conf\n.\n>\nsudo\ncp /etc/apache2/httpd.conf /etc/apache2/httpd@example_web.org.conf\nEdit\n/etc/apache2/httpd@example_web.org.conf\nand\n     change\nInclude /etc/apache2/listen.conf\nto\nInclude /etc/apache2/listen@example_web.org.conf\nReview all the directives and change them to fit your needs. You will\n     probably want to change\nInclude /etc/apache2/global.conf\nand create new\nglobal@example_web.org.conf\nfor each\n     instance. We suggest to change\nErrorLog /var/log/apache2/error_log\nto\nErrorLog /var/log/apache2/error@example_web.org_log\nto have separate logs for each instance.\nCreate\n/etc/apache2/listen@example_web.org.conf\nbased\n     on\n/etc/apache2/listen.conf\n.\n>\nsudo\ncp /etc/apache2/listen.conf /etc/apache2/listen@example_web.org.conf\nEdit\n/etc/apache2/listen@example_web.org.conf\nand\n     change\nListen 80\nto the port number you want the new instance to run on, for example 82:\nListen 82\nTo run the new Apache instance over a secured protocol (see\nSection 42.6, “Setting up a secure Web server with SSL”\n), change also the line\nListen 443\nfor example to\nListen 445\nStart the new Apache instance:\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl start apache2@example_web.org\nCheck if the server is running by pointing your Web browser at\nhttp://server_name:82\n. If you previously changed the\n     name of the error log file for the new instance, you can check it:\n>\nsudo\ntail -f /var/log/apache2/error@example_web.org_log\nHere are several points to consider when setting up more Apache instances on\n   the same server:\nThe file\n/etc/sysconfig/apache2@\nINSTANCE_NAME\ncan include the same variables as\n/etc/sysconfig/apache2\n, including module loading and\n     MPM setting.\nThe default Apache instance does not need to be running while other\n     instances run.\nThe Apache helper utilities\na2enmod\n,\na2dismod\nand\napachectl\noperate on\n     the default Apache instance if not specified otherwise with the\nHTTPD_INSTANCE\nenvironment variable. The\n     following example\n>\nsudo\nexport HTTPD_INSTANCE=example_web.org\n>\nsudo\na2enmod access_compat\n>\nsudo\na2enmod status\n>\nsudo\napachectl start\nwill add\naccess_compat\nand\nstatus\nmodules to the\nAPACHE_MODULES\nvariable of\n/etc/sysconfig/apache2@example_web.org\n, and then\n     start the\nexample_web.org\ninstance.\n42.8\nAvoiding security problems\n#\nA Web server exposed to the public Internet requires an ongoing\n   administrative effort. It is inevitable that security issues appear, both\n   related to the software and to accidental misconfiguration. Here are some\n   tips for how to deal with them.\n42.8.1\nUp-to-date software\n#\nIf there are vulnerabilities found in the Apache software, a security\n    advisory will be issued by SUSE. It contains instructions for fixing the\n    vulnerabilities, which in turn should be applied when possible. The SUSE\n    security announcements are available from the following locations:\nWeb page.\nhttps://www.suse.com/support/security/\nMailing list archive.\nhttps://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/security-announce@lists.opensuse.org/\nList of security announcements.\nhttps://www.suse.com/support/update/\n42.8.2\nDocumentRoot permissions\n#\nBy default in\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n, the\nDocumentRoot\ndirectory\n/srv/www/htdocs\nand the CGI directory\n/srv/www/cgi-bin\nbelong to the user and group\nroot\n. You should not change these permissions. If\n    the directories are writable for all, any user can place files into them.\n    These files might then be executed by Apache with the permissions of\nwwwrun\n, which may give the user unintended access\n    to file system resources. Use subdirectories of\n/srv/www\nto place the\nDocumentRoot\nand CGI directories for your virtual\n    hosts and make sure that directories and files belong to user and group\nroot\n.\n42.8.3\nFile system access\n#\nBy default, access to the whole file system is denied in\n/etc/apache2/httpd.conf\n. You should never overwrite\n    these directives, but specifically enable access to all directories Apache\n    should be able to read. For details, see\nSection 42.2.2.1.3, “Basic virtual host configuration”\n.\n    In doing so, ensure that no critical files, such as password or system\n    configuration files, can be read from the outside.\n42.8.4\nCGI scripts\n#\nInteractive scripts in PHP, SSI, or any other programming language can\n    essentially run arbitrary commands and therefore present a general security\n    issue. Scripts that will be executed from the server should only be\n    installed from sources the server administrator trusts—allowing users\n    to run their own scripts is generally not a good idea. It is also\n    recommended to do security audits for all scripts.\nTo make the administration of scripts as easy as possible, it is common\n    practice to limit the execution of CGI scripts to specific directories\n    instead of globally allowing them. The directives\nScriptAlias\nand\nOption\n    ExecCGI\nare used for configuration. The\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\ndefault\n    configuration does not allow execution of CGI scripts from everywhere.\nAll CGI scripts run as the same user, so different scripts can potentially\n    conflict with each other. The module suEXEC lets you run CGI scripts under\n    a different user and group.\n42.8.5\nUser directories\n#\nWhen enabling user directories (with\nmod_userdir\nor\nmod_rewrite\n) you should strongly consider not\n    allowing\n.htaccess\nfiles, which would allow users to\n    overwrite security settings. At least you should limit the user's\n    engagement by using the directive\nAllowOverRide\n.\n    In\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n,\n.htaccess\nfiles are enabled by\n    default, but the user is not allowed to overwrite any\nOption\ndirectives when using\nmod_userdir\n(see the\n/etc/apache2/mod_userdir.conf\nconfiguration file).\n42.9\nTroubleshooting\n#\nIf Apache does not start, the Web page is not accessible, or users cannot\n   connect to the Web server, it is important to find the cause of the problem.\n   Here are some typical places to look for error explanations and important\n   things to check:\nOutput of the\napache2.service\nsubcommand:\nInstead of starting and stopping the Web server with the binary\n/usr/sbin/apache2ctl\n, rather use the\nsystemctl\ncommands instead (described in\nSection 42.3, “Starting and stopping Apache”\n).\nsystemctl\n      status apache2.service\nis verbose about errors, and it even\n      provides tips and hints for fixing configuration errors.\nLog files and verbosity\nIn case of both fatal and nonfatal errors, check the Apache log files for\n      causes, mainly the error log file located at\n/var/log/apache2/error_log\nby default. Additionally,\n      you can control the verbosity of the logged messages with the\nLogLevel\ndirective if more detail is needed in\n      the log files.\nTip: A simple test\nWatch the Apache log messages with the command\ntail -F\n       /var/log/apache2/\nMY_ERROR_LOG\n. Then\n       run\nsystemctl restart apache2.service\n. Now, try to\n       connect with a browser and check the output.\nFirewall and ports\nA common mistake is to not open the ports for Apache in the firewall\n      configuration of the server. If you configure Apache with YaST, there\n      is a separate option available to take care of this specific issue (see\nSection 42.2.3, “Configuring Apache with YaST”\n). If you are configuring\n      Apache manually, open firewall ports for HTTP and HTTPS via YaST's\n      firewall module.\nIf the error cannot be tracked down with any of these, check the online\n   Apache bug database at\nhttp://httpd.apache.org/bug_report.html\n. Additionally,\n   the Apache user community can be reached via a mailing list available at\nhttp://httpd.apache.org/userslist.html\n.\n42.10\nMore information\n#\nThe package\napache2-doc\ncontains the complete\n   Apache manual in various localizations for local installation and reference.\n   It is not installed by default—the quickest way to install it is to\n   use the command\nzypper in apache2-doc\n. Having been\n   installed, the Apache manual is available at\nhttp://localhost/manual/\n. You may also access it on the\n   Web at\nhttps://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/\n.

Depending on the configuration, they\n    can also upload files to the FTP server. YaST uses vsftpd (Very Secure\n    FTP Daemon).\nIf the YaST FTP Server module is not available in your system, install the\nyast2-ftp-server\npackage. (For\n  managing the FTP server from the command line, see\nSection 4.4.3.7, “yast ftp-server”\n.)\nTo configure the FTP server using YaST, follow these steps:\nOpen the YaST control center and choose\nNetwork\n    Services\n›\nFTP Server\nor run the\nyast2 ftp-server\ncommand as\nroot\n.\nIf there is not any FTP server installed in your system, you will be asked\n    which server to install when the YaST FTP Server module starts. Choose\n    the vsftpd server and confirm the dialog.\nIn the\nStart-Up\ndialog, configure the options for\n    starting of the FTP server. For more information, see\nSection 43.1, “Starting the FTP server”\n.\nIn the\nGeneral\ndialog, configure FTP directories,\n    welcome message, file creation masks and other parameters. For more\n    information, see\nSection 43.2, “FTP general settings”\n.\nIn the\nPerformance\ndialog, set the parameters that\n    affect the load on the FTP server. For more information, see\nSection 43.3, “FTP performance settings”\n.\nIn the\nAuthentication\ndialog, set whether the FTP server\n    should be available for anonymous and/or authenticated users. For more\n    information, see\nSection 43.4, “Authentication”\n.\nIn the\nExpert Settings\ndialog, configure the operation\n    mode of the FTP server, SSL connections and firewall settings. For more\n    information, see\nSection 43.5, “Expert settings”\n.\nClick\nFinish\nto save the configurations.\n43.1\nStarting the FTP server\n#\nIn the\nService Start\nframe of the\nFTP\n   Start-Up\ndialog set the way the FTP server is started up. You can\n   choose between starting the server automatically during the system boot and\n   starting it manually. If the FTP server should be started only after an FTP\n   connection request, choose\nVia socket\n.\nThe current status of the FTP server is shown in the\nSwitch On and\n   Off\nframe of the\nFTP Start-Up\ndialog. Start the\n   FTP server by clicking\nStart FTP Now\n. To stop the server,\n   click\nStop FTP Now\n. After having changed the settings of\n   the server click\nSave Settings and Restart FTP Now\n. Your\n   configurations will be saved by leaving the configuration module with\nFinish\n.\nFigure 43.1:\nFTP server configuration — start-up\n#\n43.2\nFTP general settings\n#\nIn the\nGeneral Settings\nframe of the\nFTP General\n   Settings\ndialog you can set the\nWelcome message\nwhich is shown after connecting to the FTP server.\nIf you check the\nChroot Everyone\noption, all local users\n   will be placed in a chroot jail in their home directory after login. This\n   option has security implications, especially if the users have upload\n   permission or shell access, so be careful enabling this option.\nIf you check the\nVerbose Logging\noption, all FTP requests\n   and responses are logged.\nYou can limit permissions of files created by anonymous and/or authenticated\n   users with umask. Set the file creation mask for anonymous users in\nUmask for Anonymous\nand the file creation mask for\n   authenticated users in\nUmask for Authenticated Users\n. The\n   masks should be entered as octal numbers with a leading zero. For more\n   information about umask, see the umask man page\n   (\nman 1p umask\n).\nIn the\nFTP Directories\nframe set the directories used for\n   anonymous and authorized users. With\nBrowse\n, you can\n   select a directory to be used from the local file system. The default FTP\n   directory for anonymous users is\n/srv/ftp\n. Note that\n   vsftpd does not allow this directory to be writable for all users. The\n   subdirectory\nupload\nwith write permissions for\n   anonymous users is created instead.\n43.3\nFTP performance settings\n#\nIn the\nPerformance\ndialog set the parameters which affect\n   the load on the FTP server.\nMax Idle Time\nis the maximum\n   time (in minutes) the remote client may spend between FTP commands. In case\n   of longer inactivity, the remote client is disconnected.\nMax\n   Clients for One IP\ndetermines the maximum number of clients which\n   can be connected from a single IP address.\nMax Clients\ndetermines the maximum number of clients which may be connected. Any\n   additional clients will get an error message.\nThe maximum data transfer rate (in KB/s) is set in\nLocal Max\n   Rate\nfor local authenticated users, and in\nAnonymous Max\n   Rate\nfor anonymous clients respectively. The default value for the\n   rate settings is\n0\n, which means unlimited data transfer\n   rate.\n43.4\nAuthentication\n#\nIn the\nEnable/Disable Anonymous and Local Users\nframe of\n   the\nAuthentication\ndialog, you can set which users are\n   allowed to access your FTP server. You can choose between the following\n   options: granting access to anonymous users only, to authenticated users\n   only (with accounts on the system) or to both types of users.\nTo allow users to upload files to the FTP server, check\nEnable Upload\nin the\nUploading\nframe\n   of the\nAuthentication\ndialog. Here you can allow\n   uploading or creating directories even for anonymous users by checking the\n   respective box.\nNote: vsftp—allowing file upload for anonymous users\nIf a vsftpd server is used and you want anonymous users to be able to\n    upload files or create directories, a subdirectory with writing permissions\n    for all users needs to be created in the anonymous FTP directory.\n43.5\nExpert settings\n#\nAn FTP server can run in active or in passive mode. By default the server\n   runs in passive mode. To switch into active mode, deselect the\nEnable\n   Passive Mode\noption in the\nExpert Settings\ndialog.\n   You can also change the range of ports on the server used for the data\n   stream by tweaking the\nMin Port for Pas. Mode\nand\nMax Port for Pas. Mode\noptions.\nIf you want encrypted communication between clients and the server, you can\nEnable SSL\nand, additionally,\nEnable\n   TLS\n. Specify the RSA certificate to be used for SSL encrypted\n   connections.\nImportant\nBy default, new versions of the\nvsftpd\ndaemon have the TLS protocol older than version 1.2 disabled.\n    If you use an FTP client that requires an older version of the TLS protocol,\n    you need to add the following configuration to the\n/etc/vsftpd.conf\nfile:\nssl_tlsv1 = YES\nssl_tlsv1_1 = YES\nThen restart the\nvsftpd\ndaemon to\n    reread the configuration:\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl restart vsftpd.service\nIf your system is protected by a firewall, check\nOpen Port in\n   Firewall\nto enable a connection to the FTP server.\n43.6\nMore information\n#\nFor more information about the FTP server read the manual pages of\nvsftpd\nand\nvsftpd.conf\n.\nOn this page\n43.1\nStarting the FTP server\n43.2\nFTP general settings\n43.3\nFTP performance settings\n43.4\nAuthentication\n43.5\nExpert settings\n43.6\nMore information\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

It can be set up in multiple hierarchies to assure optimal\n    response times and low bandwidth usage, even in modes that are transparent\n    to end users.\nSquid acts as a caching proxy server. It redirects object requests from\n  clients (in this case, from Web browsers) to the server. When the requested\n  objects arrive from the server, it delivers the objects to the client and\n  keeps a copy of them in the hard disk cache. An advantage of caching is that\n  several clients requesting the same object can be served from the hard disk\n  cache. This enables clients to receive the data much faster than from the\n  Internet. This procedure also reduces the network traffic.\nAlong with actual caching, Squid offers a wide range of features:\nDistributing load over intercommunicating hierarchies of proxy servers\nDefining strict access control lists for all clients accessing the proxy\n    server\nAllowing or denying access to specific Web pages using other applications\nGenerating statistics about frequently-visited Web pages for the assessment\n    of surfing habits\nSquid is not a generic proxy server. It normally proxies only HTTP\n  connections. It supports the protocols FTP, Gopher, SSL, and WAIS, but it\n  does not support other Internet protocols, such as the news protocol, or\n  video conferencing protocols. Because Squid only supports the UDP protocol to\n  provide communication between different caches, many multimedia programs are\n  not supported.\n44.1\nSome facts about proxy servers\n#\nAs a caching proxy server, Squid can be used in several ways. When combined\n   with a firewall, it can help with security. Multiple proxies can be used\n   together. It can also determine what types of objects should be cached and\n   for how long.\n44.1.1\nSquid and security\n#\nIt is possible to use Squid together with a firewall to secure internal\n    networks from the outside. The firewall denies all clients access to\n    external services except Squid. All Web connections must be established by\n    the proxy server. With this configuration, Squid completely controls Web\n    access.\nIf the firewall configuration includes a demilitarized zone (DMZ), the\n    proxy server should operate within this zone.\nSection 44.6, “Configuring a transparent proxy”\ndescribes how to implement a\ntransparent\nproxy. This simplifies the configuration\n    of the clients, because in this case, they do not need any information\n    about the proxy server.\n44.1.2\nMultiple caches\n#\nSeveral instances of Squid can be configured to exchange objects between\n    them. This reduces the total system load and increases the chances of\n    retrieving an object from the local network. It is also possible to\n    configure cache hierarchies, so a cache can forward object requests to\n    sibling caches or to a parent cache—causing it to request objects\n    from another cache in the local network, or directly from the source.\nChoosing the appropriate topology for the cache hierarchy is very\n    important, because it is not desirable to increase the overall traffic on\n    the network. For a very large network, it would make sense to configure a\n    proxy server for every subnet and connect them to a parent proxy server,\n    which in turn is connected to the caching proxy server of the ISP.\nAll this communication is handled by ICP (Internet cache protocol) running\n    on top of the UDP protocol. Data transfers between caches are handled using\n    HTTP (hypertext transmission protocol) based on TCP.\nTo find the most appropriate server from which to request objects, a cache\n    sends an ICP request to all sibling proxies. The sibling proxies answer\n    these requests via ICP responses. If the object was detected, they use the\n    code\nHIT\n, if not, they use\nMISS\n.\nIf multiple\nHIT\nresponses were found, the proxy server\n    decides from which server to download, depending on factors such as which\n    cache sent the fastest answer or which one is closer. If no satisfactory\n    responses are received, the request is sent to the parent cache.\nNote: How Squid avoids duplication of objects\nTo avoid duplication of objects in different caches in the network, other\n     ICP protocols are used, such as CARP (cache array routing protocol) or\n     HTCP (hypertext cache protocol). The more objects maintained in the\n     network, the greater the possibility of finding the desired object.\n44.1.3\nCaching Internet objects\n#\nMany objects available in the network are not static, such as dynamically\n    generated pages and TLS/SSL-encrypted content. Objects like these are not\n    cached because they change each time they are accessed.\nTo determine how long objects should remain in the cache, objects are\n    assigned one of several states. Web and proxy servers find out the status\n    of an object by adding headers to these objects, such as\n“\nLast\n    modified\n”\nor\n“\nExpires\n”\nand the corresponding date.\n    Other headers specifying that objects must not be cached can be used as\n    well.\nObjects in the cache are normally replaced, because of a lack of free disk\n    space, using algorithms such as LRU (last recently used). This means that\n    the proxy expunges those objects that have not been requested for the\n    longest time.\n44.2\nSystem requirements\n#\nSystem requirements largely depend on the maximum network load that the\n   system must bear. Therefore, examine load peaks, as during those times, load\n   might be more than four times the day's average. When in doubt, slightly\n   overestimate the system's requirements. Having Squid working close to the\n   limit of its capabilities can lead to a severe loss in quality of service.\n   The following sections point to system factors in order of significance:\nRAM size\nCPU speed/physical CPU cores\nSize of the disk cache\nHard disks/SSDs and their architecture\n44.2.1\nRAM\n#\nThe amount of memory (RAM) required by Squid directly correlates with the\n    number of objects in the cache. Random access memory is much faster than a\n    hard disk/SSD. Therefore, it is very important to have sufficient memory\n    for the Squid process, because system performance is dramatically reduced\n    if the swap disk is used.\nSquid also stores cache object references and frequently requested objects\n    in the main memory to speed up retrieval of this data. In addition to that,\n    there is other data that Squid needs to keep in memory, such as a table\n    with all the IP addresses handled, an exact domain name cache, the most\n    frequently requested objects, access control lists, buffers, and more.\n44.2.2\nCPU\n#\nSquid is tuned to work best with lower processor core counts (4–8\n    physical cores), with each providing high performance. Technologies\n    providing virtual cores such as hyperthreading can hurt performance.\nTo make the best use of multiple CPU cores, it is necessary to set up\n    multiple worker threads writing to different caching devices. By default,\n    multi-core support is mostly disabled.\n44.2.3\nSize of the disk cache\n#\nIn a small cache, the probability of a\nHIT\n(finding the\n    requested object already located there) is small, because the cache is\n    easily filled and less requested objects are replaced by newer ones. If,\n    for example, 1 GB is available for the cache and the users use up only\n    10 MB per day surfing, it would take more than one hundred days to\n    fill the cache.\nThe easiest way to determine the necessary cache size is to consider the\n    maximum transfer rate of the connection. With a 1 Mbit/s connection,\n    the maximum transfer rate is 128 KB/s. If all this traffic ended up in\n    the cache, in one hour it would add up to 460 MB. Assuming that all\n    this traffic is generated in only eight working hours, it would reach\n    3.6 GB in one day. Because the connection is normally not used to its\n    upper volume limit, it can be assumed that the total data volume handled by\n    the cache is approximately 2 GB. Hence, in this example, 2 GB of\n    disk space is required for Squid to keep one day's worth of browsing data\n    cached.\n44.2.4\nHard disk/SSD architecture\n#\nSpeed plays an important role in the caching process, so this factor\n    deserves special attention. For hard disks/SSDs, this parameter is\n    described as\nrandom seek time\nor\nrandom read\n    performance\n, measured in milliseconds. Because the data blocks\n    that Squid reads from or writes to the hard disk/SSD tend to be small, the\n    seek time/read performance of the hard disk/SSD is more important than its\n    data throughput.\nFor use as a proxy server, hard disks with high rotation speeds or SSDs are\n    the best choice. When using hard disks, it can be better to use multiple\n    smaller hard disks, each with a single cache directory to avoid excessive\n    read times.\nUsing a RAID system allows increasing reliability at expense of speed.\n    However, for performance reasons, avoid (software) RAID5 and similar\n    settings.\nIn most cases, the choice of file system choice does not matter. However,\n    using the mount option\nnoatime\ncan improve performance—Squid provides its\n    own time stamps, so it does not need the file system to track access\n    times.\n44.3\nBasic usage of Squid\n#\nSince\nsquid\nis not installed by default on\nSUSE® Linux Enterprise Server\n, make sure the package is installed on your system.\nAs Squid is preconfigured in\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n, you can start it immediately\n   after the installation. To avoid problems during the start-up, make sure that\n   the network is connected to the Internet connection and has at least one\n   name server. Using a dial-up connection with a dynamic DNS configuration may\n   cause problems. In this case, specify at least the name server, as Squid does\n   not start if it does not detect a DNS server in\n/var/run/netconfig/resolv.conf\n.\n44.3.1\nStarting Squid\n#\nTo start Squid, run the following command:\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl start squid\nTo start Squid on system boot, enable the service\n    with\nsystemctl enable squid\n.\n44.3.2\nChecking whether Squid is working\n#\nThere are several ways to check whether Squid is running:\nUsing\nsystemctl\n:\n>\nsystemctl status squid\nThe output should indicate that Squid is\nloaded\nand\nactive (running)\n.\nUsing Squid itself:\n>\nsudo\nsquid -k check | echo $?\nThe output should be\n0\n, but it can also contain\n      additional messages, such as warnings.\nTo test the functionality of Squid on the local system, choose one of the\n    following options:\nUse\nsquidclient\n, a command-line tool\n      that outputs the response to a Web request, similar to\nwget\nor\ncurl\n.\nUnlike\nwget\nor\ncurl\n,\nsquidclient\nautomatically connects to the default proxy\n      setup of Squid,\nlocalhost:3128\n. However, if you modified the\n      configuration of Squid, you must configure\nsquidclient\naccordingly. For more information, see\nsquidclient --help\n.\nExample 44.1:\nA request with\nsquidclient\n#\n>\nsquidclient http://www.example.org\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nCache-Control: max-age=604800\nContent-Type: text/html\nDate: Fri, 22 Jun 2016 12:00:00 GMT\nExpires: Fri, 29 Jun 2016 12:00:00 GMT\nLast-Modified: Fri, 09 Aug 2013 23:54:35 GMT\nServer: ECS (iad/182A)\nVary: Accept-Encoding\nX-Cache: HIT\nx-ec-custom-error: 1\nContent-Length: 1270\nX-Cache: MISS from moon\n1\nX-Cache-Lookup: MISS from moon:3128\nVia: 1.1 moon (squid/3.5.16)\n2\nConnection: close\n\n<!doctype html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Example domain</title>\n[...]\n</body>\n</html>\nThe output shown in\nExample 44.1, “A request with\nsquidclient\n”\nconsists of two parts:\nThe protocol headers of the response (the lines before the blank line).\nThe actual content of the response (the lines after the blank line).\nTo verify that Squid is used, refer to the selected header lines:\n1\nThe value of the header\nX-Cache\nshows that the\n         requested document was not in the Squid cache\n         (\nMISS\n) of the computer\nmoon\n.\nThe example above contains two\nX-Cache\nlines. The\n         first\nX-Cache\nheader can be safely ignored, as it is\n         produced by the internal caching software of the originating Web\n         server.\n2\nThe value of the header\nVia\nshows the HTTP\n         version, the name of the computer, and the version of Squid in use.\nUsing a browser: Set up\nlocalhost\nas the proxy and\n3128\nas the port. Then load a page and check the\n      response headers in the\nNetwork\npanel of the browser's\nInspector\nor\nDeveloper Tools\n.\n      The headers should be reproduced similarly to the way shown in\nExample 44.1, “A request with\nsquidclient\n”\n.\nTo allow users from the local system and other systems to access Squid and\n    the Internet, change the entry in the configuration files\n/etc/squid/squid.conf\nfrom\nhttp_access deny\n    all\nto\nhttp_access allow all\n. However, keep in\n    mind that this makes Squid fully accessible to anyone. Therefore, define\n    ACLs (access control lists) that control access to the proxy server. After\n    modifying the configuration file, Squid must be reloaded or restarted. For\n    more information on ACLs, see\nSection 44.5.2, “Options for access controls”\n.\nIf Squid stops working after a short period of time, check whether there is\n    an incorrect name server entry or whether the\n/var/run/netconfig/resolv.conf\nfile is missing. Squid\n    logs the cause of a start-up failure in the file\n/var/log/squid/cache.log\n.\n44.3.3\nStopping, reloading, and restarting Squid\n#\nThere are two ways to reload Squid:\nUsing\nsystemctl\n:\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl\nreload squid\nor\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl\nrestart squid\nUsing YaST:\nIn the Squid module, click the\nSave Settings and Restart Squid\n      Now\nbutton.\nTo stop Squid, use one of the following options:\nUsing\nsystemctl\n:\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl\nstop squid\nUsing YaST\nIn the Squid module click the\nStop Squid Now\n. button.\nShutting down Squid can take a while, because Squid waits up to half a\n    minute before dropping the connections to the clients and writing its data\n    to the disk (see\nshutdown_lifetime\noption in\n/etc/squid/squid.conf\n),\nWarning: Terminating Squid\nTerminating Squid with\nkill\nor\nkillall\ncan damage the cache. To be able to restart\n     Squid, damaged caches must be deleted.\n44.3.4\nRemoving Squid\n#\nRemoving Squid from the system does not remove the cache hierarchy and log\n    files. To remove them, delete the\n/var/cache/squid\ndirectory manually.\n44.3.5\nLocal DNS server\n#\nSetting up a local DNS server makes sense even if it does not manage its\n    own domain. In that case, it acts as a caching-only name server, and it can also resolve DNS requests via the root name servers without requiring\n    any special configuration (see\nSection 39.4, “Starting the BIND name server”\n). How this\n    can be done depends on whether you chose dynamic DNS during the\n    configuration of the Internet connection.\nDynamic DNS\nNormally, with dynamic DNS, the DNS server is set by the provider when establishing the Internet connection and the local\n/var/run/netconfig/resolv.conf\nfile is adjusted\n       automatically. This behavior is specified in the\n/etc/sysconfig/network/config\nfile using the\nNETCONFIG_DNS_POLICY\nsysconfig variable. Set\nNETCONFIG_DNS_POLICY\nto\n\"\"\nwith the YaST sysconfig editor.\nThen add the local DNS server in the\n/var/run/netconfig/resolv.conf\nfile with the IP\n       address\n127.0.0.1\nfor\nlocalhost\n. This way, Squid\n       can always find the local name server when it starts.\nTo make the provider's name server accessible, specify it in the\n       configuration file\n/etc/named.conf\nunder\nforwarders\nalong with its IP address. With\n       dynamic DNS, this can be done automatically when establishing the\n       connection by setting the sysconfig variable\nNETCONFIG_DNS_POLICY\nto\nauto\n.\nStatic DNS\nWith static DNS, no automatic DNS adjustments take place while\n       establishing a connection, so there is no need to change any sysconfig\n       variables. However, you must specify the local DNS server in the file\n/var/run/netconfig/resolv.conf\nas described in\nDynamic DNS\n. Additionally, the provider's\n       static name server must be specified manually in the\n/etc/named.conf\nfile under\nforwarders\nalong with its IP address.\nTip: DNS and firewall\nIf you have a firewall running, make sure DNS requests can pass through it.\n44.4\nThe YaST Squid module\n#\nThe YaST Squid module contains the following tabs:\nStart-Up\nSpecifies how Squid is started and which firewall port is open in which\n      interfaces.\nHTTP Ports\nDefine all ports for Squid to listen for HTTP requests from clients.\nRefresh Patterns\nDefines how Squid treats objects in the cache.\nCache Settings\nDefines settings related to cache memory, maximum and minimum object\n      size, and more.\nCache Directory\nDefines the top-level directory for Squid to store cache swap files.\nAccess Control\nControls the access to the Squid server via ACL groups.\nLogging and Timeout\nDefine paths to access, cache, and cache store log files in addition with\n      connection timeouts and client lifetime.\nMiscellaneous\nSpecifies language and mail address of administrator.\n44.5\nThe Squid configuration file\n#\nSquid proxy server settings are stored in the\n/etc/squid/squid.conf\nfile. Although starting Squid for\n   the first time does not require any changes to the file, external clients are\n   initially denied access. The proxy is available for\nlocalhost\n. The default port is\n3128\n. The preinstalled configuration file\n/etc/squid/squid.conf\nprovides detailed information\n   about the options and many examples.\nMany entries are disabled using the comment character\n#\n. The relevant specifications can be found at the end of\n   the line. The given values usually correlate with the default values, so\n   removing the comment signs without changing any of the parameters usually\n   has no effect. If possible, leave the commented lines as they are and insert\n   the options along with the modified values in the line below. This way, the\n   default values may easily be recovered and compared with the changes.\nTip: Adapting the configuration file after an update\nIf you have updated from an earlier Squid version, it is recommended to\n    edit the new\n/etc/squid/squid.conf\nand only apply the\n    changes made in the previous file.\nSometimes, Squid options are added, removed, or modified. Therefore, if you\n    try to use the old\nsquid.conf\n, Squid might stop\n    working properly.\n44.5.1\nGeneral configuration options\n#\nThe following is a list of a selection of configuration options for Squid.\n    It is not exhaustive. The Squid package contains a full, lightly documented\n    list of options in\n/etc/squid/squid.conf.documented\n.\nhttp_port\nPORT\nThis is the port on which Squid listens for client requests. The default\n       port is\n3128\n, but\n8080\nis also common.\ncache_peer\nHOST_NAME\nTYPE\nPROXY_PORT\nICP_PORT\nThis option allows creating a network of caches that work together. The\n       cache peer is a computer that also hosts a network cache and stands in a\n       relationship to your own. The type of relationship is specified as the\nTYPE\n. The type can either be\nparent\nor\nsibling\n.\nAs the\nHOST_NAME\n, specify the name or IP\n       address of the proxy server to use. For\nPROXY_PORT\n, specify the port number for use\n       in a browser (usually\n8080\n). Set\nICP_PORT\nto\n7\nor, if the ICP\n       port of the parent is not known and its use is irrelevant to the\n       provider, to\n0\n.\nTo make Squid behave like a Web browser instead of a proxy server,\n       disable the use of the ICP protocol by appending the\n       options\ndefault\nand\nno-query\n.\ncache_mem\nSIZE\nThis option defines the amount of memory Squid can use for the most\n       frequent replies. The default is\n8 MB\n. This does not\n       specify the memory usage of Squid and may be exceeded.\ncache_dir\nSTORAGE_TYPE\nCACHE_DIRECTORY\nCACHE_SIZE\nLEVEL_1_DIRECTORIES\nLEVEL_2_DIRECTORIES\nThe option\ncache_dir\ndefines the directory for the\n       disk cache. In the default configuration on\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n, Squid does\n       not create a disk cache.\nThe placeholder\nSTORAGE_TYPE\ncan be one of\n       the following:\nDirectory-based storage types:\nufs\n,\naufs\n(the default),\ndiskd\n. All\n         three are variations of the storage format\nufs\n.\n         However, while\nufs\nruns as part of the core Squid\n         thread,\naufs\nruns in a separate thread, and\ndiskd\nuses a separate process. This means that the\n         latter two types avoid blocking Squid because of disk I/O.\nDatabase-based storage systems:\nrock\n. This storage\n         format relies on a single database file, in which each object takes up\n         one or more memory units of a fixed size (\n“\nslots\n”\n).\nIn the following, only the parameters for storage types based on\nufs\nwill be discussed.\nrock\nhas\n       somewhat different parameters.\nThe\nCACHE_DIRECTORY\nis the directory for the\n       disk cache. By default, that is\n/var/cache/squid\n.\nCACHE_SIZE\nis the maximum size of that\n       directory in megabytes; by default, this is set to 100 MB. Set it\n       to between 50% and a maximum of 80% of available disk space.\nThe\nLEVEL_1_DIRECTORIES\nand\nLEVEL_2_DIRECTORIES\nvalues specify how many\n       subdirectories are created in the\nCACHE_DIRECTORY\n. By default, 16\n       subdirectories are created at the first level below\nCACHE_DIRECTORY\nand 256 within each of these.\n       These values should only be increased with caution, because creating too\n       many directories can lead to performance problems.\nIf you have several disks that share a cache, specify several\ncache_dir\nlines.\ncache_access_log\nLOG_FILE\n,\ncache_log\nLOG_FILE\n,\ncache_store_log\nLOG_FILE\nThese three options specify the paths where Squid logs all its actions.\n       Normally, nothing needs to be changed here. If Squid is under heavy load, it might make sense to distribute the cache and the log\n       files over several disks.\nclient_netmask\nNETMASK\nThis option allows masking IP addresses of clients in the log files by\n       applying a subnet mask. For example, to set the last digit of the IP\n       address to\n0\n, specify\n255.255.255.0\n.\nftp_user\nE-MAIL\nThis option allows setting the password that Squid should use for\n       anonymous FTP login. Specify a valid e-mail address here, as some\n       FTP servers check these for validity.\ncache_mgr\nE-MAIL\nWhen Squid crashes, it sends a message to the specified e-mail\n       address. The default is\nwebmaster\n.\nlogfile_rotate\nVALUE\nWhen used with\nsquid\n-k rotate\n,\nsquid\nrotates log files. The files are numbered and, after reaching the specified value, the oldest file is\n       overwritten. The default value is\n10\nwhich rotates log\n       files with the numbers 0 to 9.\nHowever, on\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n, rotating log files is performed automatically\n       using\nlogrotate\nand the\n       configuration file\n/etc/logrotate.d/squid\n.\nappend_domain\nDOMAIN\nUse\nappend_domain\nto specify which domain to append\n       automatically when none is given. Usually, your own domain is specified\n       here, so pointing the browser to\nwww\nnavigates to\n       your own Web server.\nforwarded_for\nSTATE\nIf this option is set to\non\n, it adds a line to the\n       header similar to this:\nX-Forwarded-For: 192.168.0.1\nIf you set this option to\noff\n, Squid removes the IP\n       address and the system name of the client from HTTP requests.\nnegative_ttl\nTIME\n,\nnegative_dns_ttl\nTIME\nIf these options are configured, Squid caches certain types of failures,\n       such as\n404\nresponses. It then refuses to issue new\n       requests, even if the resource becomes available.\nBy default,\nnegative_ttl\nis set to\n0\n,\nnegative_dns_ttl\nis set to\n1 minutes\n.\n\n       This means that negative responses to Web requests are not cached by\n       default, while negative responses to DNS requests are cached for 1\n       minute.\nnever_direct allow\nACL_NAME\nTo prevent Squid from accepting requests directly from the Internet, use\n       the option\nnever_direct\nto force connection to\n       another proxy server. This must have previously been specified in\ncache_peer\n. If\nall\nis specified as\n       the\nACL_NAME\n, all requests are forwarded\n       directly to the\nparent\n. This can be necessary, for\n       example, if you are using a provider that dictates the use of its\n       proxies or denies its firewall direct Internet access.\n44.5.2\nOptions for access controls\n#\nSquid can control the access to the proxy server through Access Control\n    Lists (ACL), lists with rules that are processed sequentially. ACLs must be\n    defined before they can be used. Squid includes default ACLs, such as\nall\nand\nlocalhost\n. However, for an ACL to take effect, it must\n    have a corresponding\nhttp_access\nrule.\nThe syntax for the option\nacl\nis as follows:\nacl\nACL_NAME\nTYPE\nDATA\nThe placeholders within this syntax stand for the following:\nACL_NAME\ncan be any name.\nFor\nTYPE\n, select from the options available in\n      the\nACCESS CONTROLS\nsection of the\n/etc/squid/squid.conf\nfile.\nThe specification for\nDATA\ndepends on the\n      individual ACL type, for example host names, IP addresses, or URLs.\nTo add rules in the YaST Squid module, open the module and click the\nAccess Control\ntab. Click\nAdd\nunder\n    the ACL Groups list and enter the name of your rule, the type, and its\n    parameters.\nFor more information on types of ACL rules, see the Squid documentation at\nhttp://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/cfgman/acl.html\n.\nExample 44.2:\nDefining ACL rules\n#\nacl mysurfers srcdomain .example.com\n1\nacl teachers src 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0\n2\nacl students src 192.168.7.0-192.168.9.0/255.255.255.0\n3\nacl lunch time MTWHF 12:00-15:00\n4\n1\nThis ACL defines\nmysurfers\nas all users coming from\n       within\n.example.com\n(as determined by a reverse\n       lookup for the IP).\n2\nThis ACL defines\nteachers\nas the users of computers\n       with IP addresses starting with\n192.168.1.\n.\n3\nThis ACL defines\nstudents\nas the users of the\n       computer with IP addresses starting with\n192.168.7.\n,\n192.168.8.\n, or\n192.168.9.\n.\n4\nThis ACL defines\nlunch\nas a time on the days Monday\n       through Friday between noon and 3 p.m.\nhttp_access allow\nACL_NAME\nhttp_access\ndefines who is allowed to use the proxy\n       server and who can access what on the Internet. You need to define ACLs\n       for this. The\nlocalhost\nand\nall\nACLs have already been defined above, and you can deny or allow access to\n       them via\ndeny\nor\nallow\n. A list containing\n       any number of\nhttp_access\nentries can be created,\n       processed from top to bottom. Depending on which occurs first, access is\n       allowed or denied to the respective URL. The last entry should always be\nhttp_access deny all\n. In the following example,\nlocalhost\nhas free access to everything, while all\n       other hosts are denied access completely:\nhttp_access allow localhost\nhttp_access deny all\nIn another example using these rules, the group\nteachers\nalways has access to\n       the Internet. The group\nstudents\nonly has access\n       between Monday and Friday during lunch time:\nhttp_access deny localhost\nhttp_access allow teachers\nhttp_access allow students lunch time\nhttp_access deny all\nFor better readability, specify all\nhttp_access\noptions as a block in the configuration file\n/etc/squid/squid.conf\n.\nurl_rewrite_program\nPATH\nUse this option to specify a URL rewriter.\nauth_param basic program\nPATH\nIf users must be authenticated on the proxy server, set a corresponding\n       program, such as\n/usr/sbin/pam_auth\n. When accessing\npam_auth\nfor the first time, the user is prompted to\n       provide a user name and a password. In addition to that, you need an ACL,\n       so only clients with a valid login can use the Internet:\nacl password proxy_auth REQUIRED\n\nhttp_access allow password\nhttp_access deny all\nIn the\nacl proxy_auth\noption, using\nREQUIRED\nmeans that all valid user names are\n       accepted.\nREQUIRED\ncan also be replaced with a list\n       of permitted user names.\nident_lookup_access allow\nACL_NAME\nUse this option to enable an ident request action to find each user's\n       identity for all clients defined by an ACL of the type\nsrc\n. To enable this for all clients, apply the\n       predefined ACL\nall\nas the\nACL_NAME\n.\nAll clients specified by\nident_lookup_access\nmust run an\n       ident daemon. On Linux, you can use\npidentd\n(package\npidentd\n) as the ident daemon. To ensure that only\n       clients with a successful ident lookup are permitted, define a\n       corresponding ACL:\nacl identhosts ident REQUIRED\n\nhttp_access allow identhosts\nhttp_access deny all\nSetting the\nacl identhosts ident\noption to\nREQUIRED\nensures that all valid user names are\n       accepted.\nREQUIRED\ncan also be replaced with a list\n       of permitted user names.\nUsing\nident\ncan slow down access time, because ident\n       lookups are repeated for each request.\n44.6\nConfiguring a transparent proxy\n#\nA transparent proxy intercepts and answers the requests of the Web browser,\n   so the Web browser receives the requested pages without knowing where they\n   are coming from. As the name indicates, the entire process is transparent to\n   the user.\nThe standard way of working with proxy servers is as follows: the Web browser\n   sends requests to a certain port of the proxy server and the proxy always\n   provides these required objects, regardless of whether they are in its\n   cache. However, in some cases using the transparent proxy mode of Squid makes\n   sense:\nWhen for security reasons it is desirable for all clients to use a proxy\n     server to access the Internet.\nWhen all clients must use a proxy server, regardless of whether they are\n     aware of it.\nWhen the proxy server in a network is moved, but the existing clients need\n     to retain their old configuration.\nProcedure 44.1:\nSquid as a transparent proxy server (command line)\n#\nIn\n/etc/squid/squid.conf\n, add the parameter\ntransparent\nto the line\nhttp_port\n. You should then have 2 lines:\nhttp_port 3128⎄\nhttp_port 3128 transparent\nRestart Squid:\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl restart squid\nSet up the firewall to redirect HTTP traffic to the port given in\nhttp_proxy\n(in the example above, it is port 3128). Then\n     reload the firewall configuration. This assumes that the zone\ninternal\nis assigned to your LAN interface.\n>\nsudo\nfirewall-cmd\n--permanent --zone=internal \\\n    --add-forward-port=port=80:proto=tcp:toport=3128:toaddr=\nLAN_IP\n>\nsudo\nfirewall-cmd\n--permanent --zone=internal --add-port=3128/tcp\n>\nsudo\nfirewall-cmd\n--reload\nReplace\nLAN_IP\nwith the IP address of your LAN\n     interface or the interface Squid is listening on.\nTo verify that everything is working properly, check the Squid log files\n     in\n/var/log/squid/access.log\n.\n44.7\nUsing the Squid cache manager CGI interface (\ncachemgr.cgi\n)\n#\nThe Squid cache manager CGI interface (\ncachemgr.cgi\n) is\n   a CGI utility for displaying statistics about the memory usage of a running\n   Squid process. It also provides a convenient way to manage the cache and view\n   statistics without logging the server.\nProcedure 44.2:\nSetting up\ncachemgr.cgi\n#\nMake sure the Apache Web server is running on your system. Configure\n     Apache as described in\nChapter 42,\nThe Apache HTTP server\n. In particular, see\nSection 42.5, “Enabling CGI scripts”\n. To check whether Apache is already\n     running, use:\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl status apache2\nIf the status is\ninactive\n, start Apache with the\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\ndefault settings:\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl start apache2\nNow enable\ncachemgr.cgi\nin\n     Apache. To do this, create a configuration file for a\nScriptAlias\n.\nCreate the file in the directory\n/etc/apache2/conf.d\nand name it\ncachemgr.conf\n. Add the following to the file:\nScriptAlias /squid/cgi-bin/ /usr/lib64/squid/\n\n<Directory \"/usr/lib64/squid/\">\nOptions +ExecCGI\nAddHandler cgi-script .cgi\nRequire host\nHOST_NAME\n</Directory>\nReplace\nHOST_NAME\nwith the host name of the\n     computer you want to access\ncachemgr.cgi\nfrom. This allows\n     only your computer to access\ncachemgr.cgi\n. To allow access\n     from anywhere, use\nRequire all granted\ninstead.\nIf Squid and the Apache Web server run on the same computer, the\n/etc/squid/squid.conf\nconfiguration file requires no\n       modifications. However, verify that the file contains the following\n       lines:\nhttp_access allow manager localhost\nhttp_access deny manager\nThis allows you to access the manager interface from your\n       computer (\nlocalhost\n) only.\nIf Squid and the Apache Web server run on different computers, you need\n       to add extra rules to allow access from the CGI script to Squid. Define\n       an ACL for the server (replace\nWEB_SERVER_IP\nwith the IP address of the Web server):\nacl webserver src\nWEB_SERVER_IP\n/255.255.255.255\nMake sure the following rules are in the configuration file. Keep in mind\n       that the order is important.\nhttp_access allow manager localhost\nhttp_access allow manager webserver\nhttp_access deny manager\n(Optional)\nOptionally, you can configure one or more passwords for\ncachemgr.cgi\n. This also gives you\n     access to more actions such as closing the cache remotely or viewing more\n     information about the cache. To enable access, configure the options\ncache_mgr\nand\ncachemgr_passwd\nwith one\n     or more password for the manager and a list of allowed actions.\nThe following example configuration enables viewing the index page, the\n    menu, and 60-minute average of counters without authentication. The\n    configuration also enables toggling offline mode using the password\nsecretpassword\nand to disable everything else.\ncache_mgr user\ncachemgr_passwd none index menu 60min\ncachemgr_passwd secretpassword offline_toggle\ncachemgr_passwd disable all\ncache_mgr\ndefines a user name.\ncache_mgr\ndefines which actions are allowed using which password.\nThe keywords\nnone\nand\ndisable\nare\n     special:\nnone\nremoves the need for a password,\ndisable\ndisables functionality outright.\nThe full list of actions can be best seen after logging in to\ncachemgr.cgi\n. To find out how\n     the operation needs to be referenced in the configuration file, see the\n     string after\n&operation=\nin the URL of the action\n     page.\nall\nis a special keyword meaning all actions.\nReload Squid and Apache to enable the changes:\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl reload squid\nTo view the statistics, go to the\ncachemgr.cgi\npage that you set\n     up before. For example, it could be\nhttp://webserver.example.org/squid/cgi-bin/cachemgr.cgi\n.\nChoose the right server. If a user name and password are configured,\n     specify them. Click\nContinue\nand browse through the\n     available statistics.\n44.8\nCache report generation with Calamaris\n#\nCalamaris is a Perl script for generating reports of cache activity in ASCII\n   or HTML format. It works with native Squid access log files. This tool does\n   not belong to the\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\ndefault installation scope—to use it,\n   install the\ncalamaris\npackage. Further info on Calamaris is\n   available at\nhttp://cord.de/calamaris-english\n.\nLog in as\nroot\n, then enter:\n#\ncat access1.log [access2.log access3.log] | calamaris\nOPTIONS\n> reportfile\nWhen using more than one log file, make sure they are ordered\n   chronologically, with older files listed first. This can be done either by\n   listing the files one after the other as in the example above or by using\naccess{1..3}.log\n.\ncalamaris\naccepts the following options:\n-a\noutput all available reports\n-w\noutput as HTML report\n-l\ninclude a message or logo in report header\nFurther information about the various options can be found in the program's\n   manual page with\nman\ncalamaris\n.\nA typical example is:\n#\ncat access.log.{10..1} access.log | calamaris -a -w \\\n> /usr/local/httpd/htdocs/Squid/squidreport.html\nThis saves the report in the directory of the Web server. Apache is required\n   to view the reports.\n44.9\nMore Information\n#\nVisit the home page of Squid at\nhttp://www.squid-cache.org/\n.

Our\n   enterprise solutions implement the standards proposed by the Distributed\n   Management Task Force. The following paragraphs describe their basic\n   components.\nDistributed Management Task Force, Inc (DMTF) is the industry organization\n   which leads the development of management standards for enterprise and\n   Internet environments. Their goal is to unify management standards and\n   initiatives, and to enable more integrated, cost effective and interoperable\n   management solutions. DMTF standards provide common system management\n   components for control and communication. Their solutions are independent of\n   platforms and technologies.\nWeb Based Enterprise\n   Management\nand the\nCommon Information Model\nare two of their key technologies.\nWeb Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) is a set of management and Internet\n   standard technologies. WBEM was developed to unify the management of\n   enterprise computing environments. It provides the ability for the industry\n   to deliver a well-integrated collection of management tools using Web\n   technologies. WBEM consists of the following standards:\nA data model: the Common Information Model (CIM) standard\nAn encoding specification: CIM-XML Encoding Specification\nA transport mechanism: CIM operations over HTTP\nThe Common Information Model is a conceptual information model that describes\n   system management. It is not bound to a particular implementation and\n   enables the interchange of management information between management\n   systems, networks, services and applications. There are two parts to CIM\n   — the CIM Specification and the CIM Schema.\nThe\nCIM Specification\ndescribes the language, naming\n     and meta schema. The meta schema is a formal definition of the model. It\n     defines the terms used to express the model and their usage and semantics.\n     The elements of the meta schema are\nclasses\n,\nproperties\n, and\nmethods\n. The\n     meta schema also supports\nindications\nand\nassociations\nas types of\nclasses\n, and\nreferences\nas types\n     of\nproperties\n.\nThe\nCIM Schema\nprovides the actual model\n     descriptions. It supplies a set of classes with properties and\n     associations that provide a well understood conceptual framework within\n     which it is possible to organize the available information about the\n     managed environment.\nThe Common Information Model Object Manager (CIMOM) is a CIM object manager\n   or, more specifically, an application that manages objects according to the\n   CIM standard. CIMOM manages communication between CIMOM providers and a CIM\n   client, where the administrator manages the system.\nCIMOM providers\nare software performing specific tasks\n   within the CIMOM that are requested by client applications. Each provider\n   instruments one or more aspects of the CIMOM's schema. These providers\n   interact directly with the hardware.\nStandards Based Linux Instrumentation for Manageability\n   (SBLIM)\nis a collection of tools designed to support Web-Based\n   Enterprise Management (WBEM). SUSE® Linux Enterprise Server uses the open source CIMOM (or CIM\n   server) from the SBLIM project called\nSmall Footprint CIM\n   Broker\n.\nSmall Footprint CIM Broker\nis a CIM server intended for\n   use in resource-limited or embedded environments. It is designed to be\n   modular and lightweight at the same time. Its based on open standards and it\n   supports CMPI providers, CIM-XML encoding, and\nManaged Object\n   Format (MOF)\n. It is highly configurable and performs stability\n   even if the provider crashes. It is also easily accessible as it supports\n   various transport protocols, such as HTTP, HTTPS, Unix domain sockets,\n   Service Location Protocol (SLP), and Java Database Connectivity (JDBC).\n45.2\nSetting up SFCB\n#\nTo set up the Small Footprint CIM Broker (SFCB) environment, make sure the\nWeb-Based Enterprise Management\npattern in YaST is\n   selected during\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\ninstallation. Alternatively, select it as a\n   component to install on a server that is already running. Make sure the\n   following packages are installed on your system:\ncim-schema, Common Information Model (CIM) schema\nContains the Common Information Model (CIM). CIM is a model for\n      describing overall management information in a network or enterprise\n      environments. CIM consists of a specification and a schema. The\n      specification defines the details for integration with other management\n      models. The schema provides the actual model descriptions.\npython2-pywbem\nContains a Python module for making CIM operation calls through the WBEM\n      protocol to query and update managed objects.\ncmpi-provider-register, CIMOM neutral provider registration\n        utility\nContains a utility allowing CMPI provider packages to register with\n      whatever CIMOM happens to be present on the system.\nsblim-sfcb, small footprint CIM broker\nContains Small Footprint CIM Broker. It is a CIM server conforming to the\n      CIM Operations over HTTP protocol. It is robust, with low resource\n      consumption and, therefore, specifically suited for embedded and resource\n      constrained environments. SFCB supports providers written against the\n      Common Manageability Programming Interface (CMPI).\nsblim-sfcc\nContains Small Footprint CIM Client library runtime libraries.\nsblim-wbemcli\nContains WBEM command line interface. It is a stand-alone command line\n      WBEM client especially suited for basic systems management tasks.\n45.2.1\nStarting, stopping and checking status for SFCB\n#\nCIM server sfcbd daemon is installed together with Web-Based Enterprise\n    Management software and is started by default at system start-up. The\n    following table explains how to start, stop and check status for sfcbd.\nTable 45.1:\nCommands for managing sfcbd\n#\nTask\nLinux Command\nStart sfcbd\nEnter\nsystemctl start sblim-sfcb.service\nas\nroot\nin the\n         command line.\nStop sfcbd\nEnter\nsystemctl stop sblim-sfcb.service\nas\nroot\nin the\n         command line.\nCheck sfcbd status\nEnter\nsystemctl status sblim-sfcb.service\nas\nroot\nin the\n         command line.\n45.2.2\nEnsuring secure access\n#\nThe default setup of SFCB is relatively secure. However, check that the\n    access to SFCB components is as secure as required for your organization.\n45.2.2.1\nCertificates\n#\nSecure Sockets Layers (SSL) transports require a certificate for secure\n     communication to occur. When SFCB is installed, it has a self-signed\n     certificate generated.\nYou can replace the path to the default certificate with a path to a\n     commercial or self-signed one by changing the\nsslCertificateFilePath:\nPATH_FILENAME\nsetting in\n/etc/sfcb/sfcb.cfg\n. The file\n     must be in PEM format.\nBy default, SFCB expects a server certificate in the following location:\n/etc/sfcb/server.pem\nTo generate a new certificate, run the following command:\n>\nsudo\nsh /usr/share/sfcb/genSslCert.sh\nGenerating SSL certificates in .\nGenerating a 2048 bit RSA private key\n...................................................................+++\n.+++\nwriting new private key to '/var/tmp/sfcb.0Bjt69/key.pem'\n-----\nBy default, the script generates certificates\nclient.pem\n,\nfile.pem\nand\nserver.pem\nin the current working directory. If you\n     want the script to generate the certificates in\n/etc/sfcb\ndirectory, you need to append the path to\n     the command. If these files already exist, a warning message is displayed,\n     and the old certificates are not overwritten.\n>\nsudo\nsh /usr/share/sfcb/genSslCert.sh /etc/sfcb\nGenerating SSL certificates in .\nWARNING: server.pem SSL Certificate file already exists.\n         old file will be kept intact.\nWARNING: client.pem SSL Certificate trust store already exists.\n         old file will be kept intact.\nYou must remove the old certificates from the file system and run the\n     command again.\nTo change the way SFCB uses certificates, see\nSection 45.2.2.3, “Authentication”\n.\n45.2.2.2\nPorts\n#\nBy default, SFCB is configured to accept all communications through the\n     secure port 5989. The following paragraphs explain the communication port\n     setup and recommended configuration.\nPort 5989 (secure)\nThe secure port that SFCB communications use via HTTPS services. This\n        is the default. With this setting, all communications between the CIMOM\n        and client applications are encrypted when sent over the Internet\n        between servers and workstations. Users must authenticate with the\n        client application to reach SFCB server. We recommend that you keep\n        this setting. For the SFCB CIMOM to communicate with the necessary\n        applications, this port must be open on routers and firewalls if they\n        are present between the client application and the nodes being\n        monitored.\nPort 5988 (insecure)\nThe insecure port that SFCB communications use via HTTP services. This\n        setting is disabled by default. With this setting, all communications\n        between the CIMOM and client applications are open for review when sent\n        over the Internet between servers and workstations by anyone, without\n        any authentication. We recommend that you use this setting only when\n        attempting to debug a problem with the CIMOM. When the problem is\n        resolved, disable the non-secure port option back. For the SFCB CIMOM\n        to communicate with the necessary applications that require non-secure\n        access, this port must be open in routers and firewalls between the\n        client application and the nodes being monitored.\nTo change the default port assignments, see\nSection 45.2.2.2, “Ports”\n.\n45.2.2.3\nAuthentication\n#\nSFCB supports HTTP basic authentication and authentication based on client\n     certificates (HTTP over SSL connections). Basic HTTP authentication is\n     enabled by specifying\ndoBasicAuth=true\nin the SFCB\n     configuration file (\n/etc/sfcb/sfcb.cfg\nby\n     default). SUSE® Linux Enterprise Server installation of SFCB supports Pluggable Authentication\n     Modules (PAM) approach; therefore the local root user can authenticate to\n     the SFCB CIMOM with local root user credentials.\nIf the\nsslClientCertificate\nconfiguration property is\n     set to\naccept\nor\nrequire\n, the SFCB HTTP adapter will request a\n     certificate from clients when connecting via HTTP over SSL (HTTPS). If\nrequire\nis specified, the client\nmust\nprovide a valid certificate\n     (according to the client trust store specified via\nsslClientTrustStore\n). If the client fails to do\n     so, the connection will be rejected by the CIM server.\nThe setting\nsslClientCertificate=accept\nmay not be\n     obvious. It is very useful if both basic and client certificate\n     authentication are allowed. If the client can provide a valid certificate,\n     HTTPS connection will be established and the basic authentication\n     procedure will not be executed.  If this function cannot verify the\n     certificate, the HTTP basic authentication will take place instead.\n45.3\nSFCB CIMOM configuration\n#\nSFCB is a lightweight implementation of the CIM server, but it is also\n   highly configurable. Several options can control its behavior. You can\n   control the SFCB server in three ways:\nby setting appropriate environment variables\nby using command line options\nby changing its configuration file\n45.3.1\nEnvironment variables\n#\nSeveral environment variables directly affect the behavior of SFCB. You\n    need to restart the SFCB daemon by\nsystemctl restart\n    sfcb\nfor these changes to take effect.\nPATH\nSpecifies the path to the\nsfcbd\ndaemon and\n       utilities.\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH\nSpecifies the path to the sfcb runtime libraries. Alternatively, you can\n       add this path to the system-wide dynamic loader configuration file\n/etc/ld.so.conf\n.\nSFCB_PAUSE_PROVIDER\nSpecifies the provider name. The SFCB server pauses after the provider\n       is loaded for the first time. You can then attach a runtime debugger to\n       the provider's process for debugging purposes.\nSFCB_PAUSE_CODEC\nSpecifies the name of the SFCB codec (currently supports only\nhttp\n. The SFCB server pauses after the codec is\n       loaded for the first time. You can then attach a runtime debugger to the\n       process.\nSFCB_TRACE\nSpecifies the level of debug messages for SFCB. Valid values are 0 (no\n       debug messages), or 1 (key debug messages) to 4 (all debug messages).\n       Default is 1.\nSFCB_TRACE_FILE\nBy default, SFCB outputs its debug messages to standard error output\n       (STDERR). Setting this variable causes the debug messages to be written\n       to a specified file instead.\nSBLIM_TRACE\nSpecifies the level of debug messages for SBLIM providers. Valid values\n       are 0 (no debug messages), or 1 (key debug messages) to 4 (all debug\n       messages).\nSBLIM_TRACE_FILE\nBy default, SBLIM provider outputs its trace messages to STDERR. Setting\n       this variable causes the trace messages to be written to a specified\n       file instead.\n45.3.2\nCommand line options\n#\nsfcbd\n, the SFCB daemon, has several command line\n    options that switch particular runtime features on or off. Enter these\n    options when SFCB daemon starts.\n-c, --config-file\n=\nFILE\nWhen SFCB daemon starts, it reads its configuration from\n/etc/sfcb/sfcb.cfg\nby default. With this option,\n       you can specify an alternative configuration file.\n-d, --daemon\nForces sfcbd and its child processes to run in the background.\n-s, --collect-stats\nTurns on runtime statistics collecting. Various sfcbd runtime statistics\n       will be written to the\nsfcbStat\nfile in the current\n       working directory. By default, no statistics are collected.\n-l, --syslog-level\n=\nLOGLEVEL\nSpecifies the level of verbosity for the system logging facility.\nLOGLEVEL\ncan be one of LOG_INFO, LOG_DEBUG,\n       or LOG_ERR, which is the default.\n-k, --color-trace\n=\nLOGLEVEL\nPrints trace output in a different color per process for easier\n       debugging.\n-t, --trace-components\n=\nNUM\nActivates component-level tracing messages, where\nNUM\nis an OR-ed bitmask integer that defines\n       which component to trace. After you specify\n-t ?\n, it\n       lists all the components and their associated integer bitmask:\n>\nsfcbd -t ?\n---   Traceable Components:     Int       Hex\n---            providerMgr:          1  0x0000001\n---            providerDrv:          2  0x0000002\n---             cimxmlProc:          4  0x0000004\n---             httpDaemon:          8  0x0000008\n---                upCalls:         16  0x0000010\n---               encCalls:         32  0x0000020\n---        ProviderInstMgr:         64  0x0000040\n---       providerAssocMgr:        128  0x0000080\n---              providers:        256  0x0000100\n---            indProvider:        512  0x0000200\n---       internalProvider:       1024  0x0000400\n---             objectImpl:       2048  0x0000800\n---                  xmlIn:       4096  0x0001000\n---                 xmlOut:       8192  0x0002000\n---                sockets:      16384  0x0004000\n---              memoryMgr:      32768  0x0008000\n---               msgQueue:      65536  0x0010000\n---             xmlParsing:     131072  0x0020000\n---         responseTiming:     262144  0x0040000\n---              dbpdaemon:     524288  0x0080000\n---                    slp:    1048576  0x0100000\nA useful value that reveals the internal functions of sfcbd but does not\n       generate too many messages, is\n-t\n2019\n.\n45.3.3\nSFCB configuration file\n#\nSFCB reads its runtime configuration from configuration file\n/etc/sfcb/sfcb.cfg\nafter starting up. This behavior\n    can be overridden using\n-c\noption at start-up.\nThe configuration file contains\noption\n:\nVALUE\npairs, one per line. When making changes\n    to this file, you can use any text editor that saves the file in a format\n    that is native to the environment you are using.\nAny setting that has the options commented out with a number sign (#) uses\n    the default setting.\nThe following list of options may not be complete. See the content of\n/etc/sfcb/sfcb.cfg\nand\n/usr/share/doc/packages/sblim-sfcb/README\nfor their\n    complete list.\n45.3.3.1\nhttpPort\n#\nPurpose\n#\nSpecifies the local port value that sfcbd should listen to receive HTTP\n     (insecure) requests from CIM clients.

To\n   understand them, you need to have basic knowledge of the Linux file system\n   and experience with the Linux command line. This chapter includes the\n   following tasks:\nInstalling CMPI providers\nTesting SFCB\nUsing\nwbemcli\nCIM client\n45.4.1\nInstalling CMPI providers\n#\nTo install a CMPI provider, you need to make sure that its shared library\n    is copied into one of the directories specified by\nproviderDirs\nconfiguration option, see\nSection 45.3.3.17, “providerDirs”\n. The provider must also be\n    properly registered using\nsfcbstage\nand\nsfcbrepos\ncommands.\nThe provider package is usually prepared for SFCB, so that its installation\n    takes care of the proper registration. Most SBLIM providers are prepared\n    for SFCB.\n45.4.1.1\nClass repository\n#\nClass repository\nis a place where SFCB stores\n     information about CIM classes. It usually consists of a directory tree\n     with namespace components. Typical CIM namespaces are\nroot/cimv2\nor\nroot/interop\n, which\n     respectively translate to the class repository directory path on the file\n     system\n/var/lib/sfcb/registration/repository/root/cimv2\nand\n/var/lib/sfcb/registration/repository/root/interop\nEach namespace directory contains the file\nclassSchemas\n. The file has a compiled binary\n     representation of all the CIM classes registered under that namespace. It\n     also contains necessary information about their CIM superclasses.\nIn addition, each namespace directory may contain a file\nqualifiers\nwhich contains all qualifiers for the\n     namespace. When sfcbd restarts, the class provider will scan the directory\n/var/lib/sfcb/registration/repository/\nand all its\n     subdirectories to determine the registered namespaces. Then\nclassSchemas\nfiles are decoded and the class\n     hierarchy for each namespace is built.\n45.4.1.2\nAdding new classes\n#\nSFCB cannot make live CIM class manipulations. You need to add, change or\n     remove classes offline and restart SFCB service with\nsystemctl\n     restart sfcb\nto register the changes.\nTo store providers class and registration information, SFCB uses a place\n     called\nstaging area\n. On SUSE® Linux Enterprise Server systems, it is the\n     directory structure under\n/var/lib/sfcb/stage/\n.\nTo add a new provider, you need to:\nCopy the provider class definition files to the\n./mofs\nsubdirectory of staging area directory\n       (\n/var/lib/sfcb/stage/mofs\n).\nCopy a registration file which contains the name of the class or classes\n       and type of provider, and the name of the executable library file into\n       the\n./regs\nsubdirectory.\nThere are two default\n“\nmof\n”\n(class definition) files in the\n     staging directory:\nindication.mof\nand\ninterop.mof\n. MOF files under the root stage directory\n/var/lib/sfcb/stage/mofs\nwill be copied into each\n     namespace after running\nsfcbrepos\ncommand. The\ninterop.mof\nwill only be compiled into the\ninterop\nnamespace.\nThe directory layout may look like the following example:\n>\nls /var/lib/sfcb/stage\ndefault.reg  mofs  regs\n>\nls /var/lib/sfcb/stage/mofs\nindication.mof  root\n>\nls /var/lib/sfcb/stage/mofs/root\ncimv2  interop  suse  virt\n>\nls -1 /var/lib/sfcb/stage/mofs/root/cimv2 | less\nLinux_ABIParameter.mof\nLinux_BaseIndication.mof\nLinux_Base.mof\nLinux_DHCPElementConformsToProfile.mof\nLinux_DHCPEntity.mof\n[..]\nOMC_StorageSettingWithHints.mof\nOMC_StorageVolumeDevice.mof\nOMC_StorageVolume.mof\nOMC_StorageVolumeStorageSynchronized.mof\nOMC_SystemStorageCapabilities.mof\n>\nls -1 /var/lib/sfcb/stage/mofs/root/interop\nComputerSystem.mof\nElementConformsToProfile.mof\nHostSystem.mof\ninterop.mof\nLinux_DHCPElementConformsToProfile.mof\n[..]\nOMC_SMIElementSoftwareIdentity.mof\nOMC_SMISubProfileRequiresProfile.mof\nOMC_SMIVolumeManagementSoftware.mof\nReferencedProfile.mof\nRegisteredProfile.mof\n>\nls -1 /var/lib/sfcb/stage/regs\nAllocationCapabilities.reg\nLinux_ABIParameter.reg\nLinux_BaseIndication.reg\nLinux_DHCPGlobal.reg\nLinux_DHCPRegisteredProfile.reg\n[..]\nOMC_Base.sfcb.reg\nOMC_CopyServices.sfcb.reg\nOMC_PowerManagement.sfcb.reg\nOMC_Server.sfcb.reg\nRegisteredProfile.reg\n>\ncat /var/lib/sfcb/stage/regs/Linux_DHCPRegisteredProfile.reg\n[Linux_DHCPRegisteredProfile]\n   provider: Linux_DHCPRegisteredProfileProvider\n   location: cmpiLinux_DHCPRegisteredProfile\n   type: instance\n   namespace: root/interop\n#\n[Linux_DHCPElementConformsToProfile]\n   provider: Linux_DHCPElementConformsToProfileProvider\n   location: cmpiLinux_DHCPElementConformsToProfile\n   type: instance association\n   namespace: root/cimv2\n#\n[Linux_DHCPElementConformsToProfile]\n   provider: Linux_DHCPElementConformsToProfileProvider\n   location: cmpiLinux_DHCPElementConformsToProfile\n   type: instance association\n   namespace: root/interop\nSFCB uses a custom provider registration file for each provider.\nNote: SBLIM providers registration files\nAll SBLIM providers on the SBLIM Web site already include a registration\n      file that is used to generate the .reg file for SFCB.\nThe format of SFCB registration file is:\n[<class-name>]\n   provider: <provide-name>\n   location: <library-name>\n   type: [instance] [association] [method] [indication]\n   group: <group-name>\n   unload: never\n   namespace: <namespace-for-class> ...\nwhere:\n<class-name>\nThe CIM class name (required)\n<provider-name>\nThe CMPI provider name (required)\n<location-name>\nThe name of the provider library (required)\ntype\nThe type of the provider (required). This can be any combination of:\ninstance\n,\nassociation\n,\nmethod\nor\nindication\n.\n<group-name>\nMultiple providers can be grouped together and run under a single\n        process to further minimize runtime resources. All providers registered\n        under the same <group-name> will be executed under the same\n        process. By default each provider will be run as a separate process.\nunload\nSpecifies the unload policy for the provider. Currently the only\n        supported option is\nnever\n, which specifies that the\n        provider will not be monitored for idle times and will never be\n        unloaded. By default each provider will be unloaded when its idle times\n        exceed the value specified in the configuration file.\nnamespace\nList of namespaces for which this provider can be executed. This is\n        required, although for most providers this will be\nroot/cimv2\n.\nOnce all the class definitions and provider registration files are stored\n     in the staging area, you need to rebuild the SFCB class repository with\n     the command\nsfcbrepos\n-f\n.\nYou can add, change or remove classes this way. After rebuilding the class\n     repository, restart SFCB with command\nsystemctl restart\n     sfcb\n.\nAlternatively, the SFCB package contains a utility that will copy provider\n     class mof files and registration files to the correct locations in the\n     staging area.\nsfcbstage\n-r\n[provider.reg]\n     [class1.mof] [class2.mof] ...\nAfter running this command you still need to rebuild the class repository\n     and restart SFCB service.\n45.4.2\nTesting SFCB\n#\nThe SFCB package includes two testing scripts:\nwbemcat\nand\nxmltest\n.\nwbemcat\nsends raw CIM-XML data via HTTP protocol to the\n    specified SFCB host (localhost by default) listening on port 5988. Then it\n    displays the returned results. The following file contains the CIM-XML\n    representation of a standard EnumerateClasses request:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<CIM CIMVERSION=\"2.0\" DTDVERSION=\"2.0\">\n  <MESSAGE ID=\"4711\" PROTOCOLVERSION=\"1.0\">\n    <SIMPLEREQ>\n      <IMETHODCALL NAME=\"EnumerateClasses\">\n        <LOCALNAMESPACEPATH>\n          <NAMESPACE NAME=\"root\"/>\n          <NAMESPACE NAME=\"cimv2\"/>\n        </LOCALNAMESPACEPATH>\n        <IPARAMVALUE NAME=\"ClassName\">\n          <CLASSNAME NAME=\"\"/>\n        </IPARAMVALUE>\n        <IPARAMVALUE NAME=\"DeepInheritance\">\n          <VALUE>TRUE</VALUE>\n        </IPARAMVALUE>\n        <IPARAMVALUE NAME=\"LocalOnly\">\n          <VALUE>FALSE</VALUE>\n        </IPARAMVALUE>\n        <IPARAMVALUE NAME=\"IncludeQualifiers\">\n          <VALUE>FALSE</VALUE>\n        </IPARAMVALUE>\n        <IPARAMVALUE NAME=\"IncludeClassOrigin\">\n          <VALUE>TRUE</VALUE>\n        </IPARAMVALUE>\n      </IMETHODCALL>\n    </SIMPLEREQ>\n  </MESSAGE>\n</CIM>\nSending this request to SFCB CIMOM returns a list of all supported classes\n    for which there is a registered provider.

It then compares the returned results\n    against a previously saved\n“\nOK\n”\nresult file. If there does not\n    yet exist a corresponding\n“\nOK\n”\nfile, it will be created for\n    later use:\n>\nxmltest cim_xml_test.xml\nRunning test cim_xml_test.xml ...

Passed\n45.4.3\nCommand line CIM client: wbemcli\n#\nIn addition to\nwbemcat\nand\nxmltest\n,\n    the SBLIM project includes a more advanced command line CIM client\nwbemcli\n. The client is used to send CIM requests to SFCB\n    server and display returned results. It is independent of CIMOM library and\n    can be used with all WBEM compliant implementations.\nFor example, if you need to list all the classes implemented by SBLIM\n    providers registered to your SFCB, send the\n“\nEnumerateClasses\n”\n(ec) request to SFCB:\n>\nwbemcli -dx ec http://localhost/root/cimv2\nTo server: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>\n<CIM CIMVERSION=\"2.0\" DTDVERSION=\"2.0\">\n<MESSAGE ID=\"4711\" PROTOCOLVERSION=\"1.0\"><SIMPLEREQ><IMETHODCALL \\\n    NAME=\"EnumerateClasses\"><LOCALNAMESPACEPATH><NAMESPACE NAME=\"root\"> \\\n    </NAMESPACE><NAMESPACE NAME=\"cimv2\"></NAMESPACE> \\\n    </LOCALNAMESPACEPATH>\n<IPARAMVALUE NAME=\"DeepInheritance\"><VALUE>TRUE</VALUE> \\\n    </IPARAMVALUE>\n<IPARAMVALUE NAME=\"LocalOnly\"><VALUE>FALSE</VALUE></IPARAMVALUE>\n<IPARAMVALUE NAME=\"IncludeQualifiers\"><VALUE>FALSE</VALUE> \\\n    </IPARAMVALUE>\n<IPARAMVALUE NAME=\"IncludeClassOrigin\"><VALUE>TRUE</VALUE> \\\n    </IPARAMVALUE>\n</IMETHODCALL></SIMPLEREQ>\n</MESSAGE></CIM>\nFrom server: Content-Type: application/xml; charset=\"utf-8\"\nFrom server: Content-Length: 337565\nFrom server: Cache-Control: no-cache\nFrom server: CIMOperation: MethodResponse\nFrom server: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>\n<CIM CIMVERSION=\"2.0\" DTDVERSION=\"2.0\">\n<MESSAGE ID=\"4711\" PROTOCOLVERSION=\"1.0\">\n<SIMPLERSP>\n<IMETHODRESPONSE NAME=\"EnumerateClasses\">\n<IRETURNVALUE>\n<CLASS NAME=\"CIM_ResourcePool\" SUPERCLASS=\"CIM_LogicalElement\">\n<PROPERTY NAME=\"Generation\" TYPE=\"uint64\">\n</PROPERTY>\n<PROPERTY NAME=\"ElementName\" TYPE=\"string\">\n</PROPERTY>\n<PROPERTY NAME=\"Description\" TYPE=\"string\">\n</PROPERTY>\n<PROPERTY NAME=\"Caption\" TYPE=\"string\">\n</PROPERTY>\n<PROPERTY NAME=\"InstallDate\" TYPE=\"datetime\">\n</PROPERTY>\n[..]\n<CLASS NAME=\"Linux_Ext4FileSystem\" SUPERCLASS=\"CIM_UnixLocalFileSystem\">\n<PROPERTY NAME=\"FSReservedCapacity\" TYPE=\"uint64\">\n</PROPERTY>\n<PROPERTY NAME=\"TotalInodes\" TYPE=\"uint64\">\n</PROPERTY>\n<PROPERTY NAME=\"FreeInodes\" TYPE=\"uint64\">\n</PROPERTY>\n<PROPERTY NAME=\"ResizeIncrement\" TYPE=\"uint64\">\n<VALUE>0</VALUE>\n</PROPERTY>\n<PROPERTY NAME=\"IsFixedSize\" TYPE=\"uint16\">\n<VALUE>0</VALUE>\n</PROPERTY>\n[..]\nThe\n-dx\noption shows you the actual XML sent to SFCB by\nwbemcli\nand the actual XML received.

Traditionally, the shell provides integrated help by\n     means of man pages and info pages. Read more in\nSection 46.2, “Man pages”\nand\nSection 46.3, “Info pages”\n.\nDesktop help center\nThe help center of the GNOME desktop (Help) provides central access to\n     the GNOME desktop documentation.\nSeparate help packages for some applications\nWhen installing new software with YaST, the software documentation is\n     usually installed automatically and appears in the help center of your\n     desktop. However, some applications, such as GIMP, may have different\n     online help packages that can be installed separately with YaST and do\n     not integrate into the help centers.\n46.1\nDocumentation directory\n#\nThe traditional directory to find documentation on your installed Linux\n    system is\n/usr/share/doc\n. The directory contains the\n    release notes and information about the packages installed on your system,\n    plus manuals and more.\nNote: Contents depend on installed packages\nIn the Linux world, manuals and other kinds of documentation are\n    available in the form of packages, like software. How much and which\n    information you find in\n/usr/share/docs\nalso depends\n    on the (documentation) packages installed. If you cannot find the\n    subdirectories mentioned here, check if the respective packages are\n    installed on your system and add them with YaST, if needed.\n46.1.1\nRelease notes\n#\nWe provide HTML, PDF, RTF and text versions of\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nrelease\n     notes. They are available on your installed system under\n/usr/share/doc/release-notes/\nor online at your\n     product-specific Web page at\nhttps://www.suse.com/releasenotes//\n.\n46.1.2\nPackage documentation\n#\nUnder\npackages\n, find the documentation\n    that is included in the software packages installed on your system. For\n    every package, a subdirectory\n/usr/share/doc/packages/\nPACKAGENAME\nis created. It often contains README files for the package and sometimes\n    examples, configuration files, or additional scripts. The following list\n    introduces typical files to be found under\n/usr/share/doc/packages\n. None of these entries are\n    mandatory and many packages might only include a few of them.\nAUTHORS\nList of the main developers.\nBUGS\nKnown bugs or malfunctions. May also contain a link to a Bugzilla Web\n       page where you can search all bugs.\nCHANGES\n,\nChangeLog\nSummary of changes from version to version. Usually interesting for\n       developers, because it is very detailed.\nCOPYING\n,\nLICENSE\nLicensing information.\nFAQ\nQuestion and answers collected from mailing lists or newsgroups.\nINSTALL\nHow to install this package on your system. As the package is already\n       installed by the time you get to read this file, you can safely ignore\n       the contents of this file.\nREADME\n,\nREADME.*\nGeneral information on the software. For example, for what purpose and\n       how to use it.\nTODO\nFeatures planned for the future.\nMANIFEST\nList of files with a brief summary.\nNEWS\nDescription of what is new in this version.\n46.2\nMan pages\n#\nMan pages are an essential part of any Linux system. They explain the usage\n   of a command and all available options and parameters. Man pages can be\n   accessed with\nman\nfollowed by the name of the command,\n   for example,\nman ls\n.\nMan pages are displayed directly in the shell. To navigate them, move up and\n   down with\nPage ↑\nand\nPage ↓\n.\n   Move between the beginning and the end of a document with\nHome\nand\nEnd\n. End this viewing\n   mode by pressing\nQ\n. Learn more about the\nman\ncommand itself with\nman man\n. Man\n   pages are sorted in categories as shown in\nTable 46.1, “Man pages—categories and descriptions”\n(taken from the man page for man\n   itself).\nTable 46.1:\nMan pages—categories and descriptions\n#\nNumber\nDescription\n1\nExecutable programs or shell commands\n2\nSystem calls (functions provided by the kernel)\n3\nLibrary calls (functions within program libraries)\n4\nSpecial files (usually found in\n/dev\n)\n5\nFile formats and conventions (\n/etc/fstab\n)\n6\nGames\n7\nMiscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), for example,\n        man(7), groff(7)\n8\nSystem administration commands (usually only for\nroot\n)\n9\nKernel routines (nonstandard)\nEach man page consists of several parts labeled\nNAME\n,\nSYNOPSIS\n,\nDESCRIPTION\n,\nSEE ALSO\n,\nLICENSING\n, and\nAUTHOR\n. There may be additional sections available\n   depending on the type of command.\n46.3\nInfo pages\n#\nInfo pages are another important source of information on your system.\n   Usually, they are more detailed than man pages. They consist of more than\n   command line options and contain sometimes whole tutorials or reference\n   documentation. To view the info page for a certain command, enter\ninfo\nfollowed by the name of the command, for example,\ninfo ls\n. You can browse an info page with a viewer\n   directly in the shell and display the different sections, called\n“\nnodes\n”\n. Use\nSpace\nto move forward and\n<—\nto move backward. Within a node, you can also\n   browse with\nPage ↑\nand\nPage ↓\nbut only\nSpace\nand\n<—\nwill\n   take you also to the previous or subsequent node. Press\nQ\nto end the viewing mode. Not every command comes with an info page and vice\n   versa.\n46.4\nOnline resources\n#\nIn addition to the online versions of the SUSE manuals installed under\n/usr/share/doc\n, you can also access the\n   product-specific manuals and documentation on the Web. For an overview of\n   all documentation available for\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\ncheck out your\n   product-specific documentation Web page at\nhttps://documentation.suse.com/\n.\nIf you are searching for additional product-related information, you can\n   also refer to the following Web sites:\nSUSE technical support\nThe SUSE Technical Support can be found at\nhttps://www.suse.com/support/\nif you have questions\n      or need solutions for technical problems.\nUser community\nSUSE and Rancher Community\nSUSE blog\nThe SUSE blog offers articles, tips, Q and A:\nhttps://www.suse.com/c/blog/\nGNOME documentation\nDocumentation for GNOME users, administrators and developers is\n      available at\nhttps://help.gnome.org/\n.\nThe Linux documentation project\nThe Linux Documentation Project (TLDP) is run by a team of volunteers who\n      write Linux-related documentation (see\nhttps://www.tldp.org\n).

It also helps\n    system administrators to check for tainted kernels (that are not supported)\n    or any third-party packages installed on a machine.\nIn case of problems, a detailed system report may be created with either\n    the\nsupportconfig\ncommand line tool or the YaST\nSupport\nmodule. Both will collect information about the\n    system such as: current kernel version, hardware, installed packages,\n    partition setup, and much more. The result is a TAR archive of files. After\n    opening a Service Request (SR), you can upload the TAR archive to Global\n    Technical Support. It will help to locate the issue you reported and to\n    assist you in solving the problem.\nAdditionally, you can analyze the\nsupportconfig\noutput\n    for known issues to help resolve problems faster. For this purpose,\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nprovides both an appliance and a command line tool for\nSupportconfig Analysis\n(SCA).\n47.1\nDisplaying current system information\n#\nFor a quick and easy overview of all relevant system information when\n   logging in to a server, use the package\nhostinfo\n. After it has been\n   installed on a machine, the console displays the following information to\n   any\nroot\nuser that logs in to this machine:\nExample 47.1:\nOutput of\nhostinfo\nwhen logging in as\nroot\n#\nWelcome to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP2 Snapshot8 (x86_64) - Kernel \\r (\\l).\n\n\nDistribution:             SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP2\nCurrent As Of:            Wed 25 Mar 2020 12:09:20 PM PDT\nHostname:                 localhost\nKernel Version:           5.3.18-8-default\n Architecture:            x86_64\n Installed:               Thu 19 Mar 2020 11:25:13 AM PDT\n Status:                  Not Tainted\nLast Installed Package:   Wed 25 Mar 2020 11:42:24 AM PDT\n Patches Needed:          0\n Security:                0\n 3rd Party Packages:      219\nNetwork Interfaces\n eth0:                    192.168.2/24 2002:c0a8:20a::/64\nMemory\n Total/Free/Avail:        7.4Gi/6.4Gi/6.8Gi (91% Avail)\nCPU Load Average:         7 (3%) with 2 CPUs\nIn case the output shows a\ntainted\nkernel status, see\nSection 47.6, “Support of kernel modules”\nfor more details.\n47.2\nCollecting system information with supportconfig\n#\nTo create a TAR archive with detailed system information that you can hand\n   over to Global Technical Support, use either:\nthe command\nsupportconfig\nor,\nthe YaST\nSupport\nmodule.\nThe command line tool is provided by the\n   package\nsupportutils\nwhich is installed by default.\n   The YaST\nSupport\nmodule is also based on the command\n   line tool.\nDepending on which packages are installed on your system, some of these\n   packages integrate Supportconfig plug-ins.  When Supportconfig is executed,\n   all plug-ins are executed as well and create one or more result files for\n   the archive. That has the benefit that the only topics checked are those\n   that contain a specific plug-in for them.  Supportconfig plug-ins are stored\n   in the directory\n/usr/lib/supportconfig/plugins/\n.\n47.2.1\nCreating a service request number\n#\nSupportconfig archives can be generated at any time. However, for\n    handing over the Supportconfig data to Global Technical Support, you need\n    to generate a service request number first. You will need it to upload the\n    archive to support.\nTo create a service request, go to\nhttps://scc.suse.com/support/requests\nand follow the\n    instructions on the screen. Write down the service request number.\nNote: Privacy statement\nSUSE treats system reports as confidential data. For\n     details about our privacy commitment, see\nhttps://www.suse.com/company/policies/privacy/\n.\n47.2.2\nUpload targets\n#\nAfter having created a service request number, you can upload your\n    Supportconfig archives to Global Technical Support as described in\nProcedure 47.1, “Submitting information to support with YaST”\nor\nProcedure 47.2, “Submitting information to support from command line”\n. Use one of the following\n    upload targets:\nNorth America: FTP\nftp://support-ftp.us.suse.com/incoming/\n, FTPS\nftps://support-ftp.us.suse.com/incoming/\nEMEA, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa: FTP\nftp://support-ftp.emea.suse.com/incoming\n, FTPS\nftps://support-ftp.emea.suse.com/incoming\nAlternatively, you can manually attach the TAR archive to your service\n    request using the service request URL:\nhttps://scc.suse.com/support/requests\n.\n47.2.3\nCreating a supportconfig archive with YaST\n#\nTo use YaST to gather your system information, proceed as follows:\nStart YaST and open the\nSupport\nmodule.\nClick\nCreate report tarball\n.\nIn the next window, select one of the Supportconfig options from the\n      radio button list.\nUse Custom (Expert) Settings\nis\n      preselected by default. If you want to test the report function first,\n      use\nOnly gather a minimum amount of info\n. For \n      additional information on the other options, refer to the\nsupportconfig\nman page.\nClick\nNext\n.\nEnter your contact information. It is saved in the\nbasic-environment.txt\nfile and included in the\n      created archive.\nTo submit the archive to Global Technical Support, provide the required\nUpload\n      Information\n. YaST automatically suggests an\n      upload server. To modify it, refer to\nSection 47.2.2, “Upload targets”\nfor details of\n      which upload servers are available.\nTo submit the archive later, leave the\nUpload Information\nempty.\nClick\nNext\nto start the information collection process.\nAfter the process is finished, click\nNext\n.\nTo review the collected data, select the desired file from\nFile\n      Name\nto view its contents in YaST. To remove a file from the\n      TAR archive before submitting it to support, use\nRemove from\n      Data\n. Press\nNext\n.\nSave the TAR archive. If you started the YaST module as\nroot\nuser, YaST prompts to save the archive to\n/var/log\n(otherwise, to your home directory). The file name format is\nscc_\nHOST\n_\nDATE\n_\nTIME\n.tbz\n.\nTo upload the archive to support directly, make sure\nUpload log\n      files tarball to URL\nis activated. The\nUpload\n      Target\nshown here is the one that YaST suggests in\nStep 5\n. To modify the upload target,\n      check which upload servers are available in\nSection 47.2.2, “Upload targets”\n.\nTo skip the upload, deactivate\nUpload log files\n      tarball to URL\n.\nConfirm the changes to close the YaST module.\n47.2.4\nCreating a supportconfig archive from command line\n#\nThe following procedure shows how to create a Supportconfig archive, but\n    without submitting it to support directly. For uploading it, you need to\n    run the command with certain options as described in\nProcedure 47.2, “Submitting information to support from command line”\n.\nOpen a shell and become\nroot\n.\nRun\nsupportconfig\n. Usually, it is enough to\n      run this tool without any options. Some options are very common and\n      are displayed in the following list:\n-E\nMAIL\n,\n-N\nNAME\n,\n-O\nCOMPANY\n,\n-P\nPHONE\nSets your contact data: e-mail address (\n-E\n), company\n         name (\n-O\n), your name (\n-N\n), and\n         your phone number (\n-P\n).\n-i\nKEYWORDS\n,\n-F\nLimits the features to check. The placeholder\nKEYWORDS\nis a comma separated list of case-sensitive keywords. Get a list\n         of all keywords with\nsupportconfig -F\n.\n-r\nSRNUMBER\nDefines your service request number when uploading the generated\n         TAR archive.\nWait for the tool to complete the operation.\nThe default archive location is\n/var/log\n, with the\n      file name format being\nscc_\nHOST\n_\nDATE\n_\nTIME\n.tbz\n47.2.5\nUnderstanding the output of\nsupportconfig\n#\nWhether you run\nsupportconfig\nthrough YaST or directly,\n    the script gives you a summary of what it did.\nSupport Utilities - Supportconfig\n                          Script Version: 3.0-98 \n                          Script Date: 2017 06 01\n[...]\nGathering system information\n  Data Directory:    /var/log/scc_d251_180201_1525\n1\nBasic Server Health Check...

Display a list of all options with\nsupportconfig\n-h\nor refer to the man\n    page. The following list gives a brief overview of some common use cases:\nReducing the size of the information being gathered\nUse the minimal option (\n-m\n):\n>\nsudo\nsupportconfig -m\nLimiting the information to a specific topic\nIf you have already localized a problem  that relates\n       to a specific area or feature set only, you should limit the collected\n       information to the specific area for the next\nsupportconfig\nrun. For example, if you detected\n       problems with LVM and want to test a recent change that you did to the\n       LVM configuration. In that case it makes sense to gather the minimum\n       Supportconfig information around LVM only:\n>\nsudo\nsupportconfig -i LVM\nAdditional keywords can be separated through commas. For example,\n       an additional disk test:\n>\nsudo\nsupportconfig -i LVM,DISK\nFor a complete list of feature keywords that you can use for limiting\n       the collected information to a specific area, run:\n>\nsudo\nsupportconfig -F\nIncluding additional contact information in the output:\n>\nsudo\nsupportconfig -E tux@example.org -N \"Tux Penguin\" -O \"Penguin Inc.\" ...\n(all in one line)\nCollecting already rotated log files\n>\nsudo\nsupportconfig -l\nThis is especially useful in high logging environments or after a kernel\n       crash when syslog rotates the log files after a reboot.\n47.2.7\nOverview of the archive content\n#\nThe TAR archive contains all the results from the features. Depending on\n    what you have selected (all or only a small set), the archive can contain\n    more or less files.\n    The set of features can be limited through the\n-i\noption (see\nSection 47.2.6, “Common supportconfig options”\n).\nTo list the content of the archive, use the following\ntar\ncommand:\n#\ntar\nxf /var/log/scc_earth_180131_1545.tbz\nThe following file names are always available inside the TAR archive:\nMinimum files in archive\n#\nbasic-environment.txt\nContains the date when this script was executed and system information\n       like version of the distribution, hypervisor information, and more.\nbasic-health-check.txt\nContains some basic health checks like uptime, virtual memory statistics,\n       free memory and hard disk, checks for zombie processes, and more.\nhardware.txt\nContains basic hardware checks like information about the CPU architecture,\n       list of all connected hardware, interrupts, I/O ports, kernel boot messages,\n       and more.\nmessages.txt\nContains log messages from the system journal.\nrpm.txt\nContains a list of all installed RPM packages, the name,\n      where they are coming from, and their versions.\nsummary.xml\nContains some information in XML format like distribution,\n      the version, and product specific fragments.\nsupportconfig.txt\nContains information about the\nsupportconfig\nscript\n       itself.\ny2log.txt\nContains YaST specific information like specific packages, configuration\n       files, and log files.\nTable 47.1, “Comparison of features and file names in the TAR archive”\nlists all available\n    features and their file names.

When you experience a server\n   issue and want the support's assistance, you will need to open a service\n   request first. For details, see\nSection 47.2.1, “Creating a service request number”\n.\nThe following examples use\n12345678901\nas a\n   placeholder for your service request number. Replace\n12345678901\nwith the service request number you\n   created in\nSection 47.2.1, “Creating a service request number”\n.\nProcedure 47.1:\nSubmitting information to support with YaST\n#\nThe following procedure assumes that you have already created a\n    Supportconfig archive, but have not uploaded it yet. Make sure to have\n    included your contact information in the archive as described in\nSection 47.2.3, “Creating a supportconfig archive with YaST”\n,\nStep 4\n.\n    For instructions on how to generate and submit a Supportconfig archive in\n    one go, see\nSection 47.2.3, “Creating a supportconfig archive with YaST”\n.\nStart YaST and open the\nSupport\nmodule.\nClick\nUpload\n.\nIn\nPackage with log files\nspecify the path to the\n     existing Supportconfig archive or\nBrowse\nfor it.\nYaST automatically proposes an upload server. If you want to modify it,\n     refer to\nSection 47.2.2, “Upload targets”\nfor details\n     of which upload servers are available.\nProceed with\nNext\n.\nClick\nFinish\n.\nProcedure 47.2:\nSubmitting information to support from command line\n#\nThe following procedure assumes that you have already created a\n    Supportconfig archive, but have not uploaded it yet. For instructions on\n    how to generate and submit a Supportconfig archive in one go, see\nSection 47.2.3, “Creating a supportconfig archive with YaST”\n.\nServers with Internet connectivity:\nTo use the default upload target, run:\n>\nsudo\nsupportconfig -ur\n12345678901\nFor the secure upload target, use the following:\n>\nsudo\nsupportconfig -ar\n12345678901\nServers\nwithout\nInternet connectivity\nRun the following:\n>\nsudo\nsupportconfig -r\n12345678901\nManually upload the\n/var/log/scc_\nSR12345678901\n*tbz\narchive to one of our FTP servers. Which one to use depends on your\n       location in the world. For an overview, see\nSection 47.2.2, “Upload targets”\n.\nAfter the TAR archive arrives in the incoming directory of our FTP server,\n     it becomes automatically attached to your service request.\n47.4\nAnalyzing system information\n#\nSystem reports created with\nsupportconfig\ncan be analyzed\n   for known issues to help resolve problems faster. For this purpose,\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nprovides both an appliance and a command line tool for\nSupportconfig Analysis\n(SCA). The SCA appliance is a\n   server-side tool which is non-interactive. The SCA tool\n   (\nscatool\nprovided by the package\nsca-server-report\n) runs on the client-side and is\n   executed from command line. Both tools analyze Supportconfig archives from\n   affected servers. The initial server analysis takes place on the SCA\n   appliance or the workstation on which\nscatool\nis\n   running. No analysis cycles happen on the production server.\nBoth the appliance and the command line tool additionally need\n   product-specific patterns that enable them to analyze the Supportconfig\n   output for the associated products. Each pattern is a script that parses and\n   evaluates a Supportconfig archive for one known issue. The patterns are\n   available as RPM packages.\nYou can also develop your own patterns as briefly described in\nSection 47.4.3, “Developing custom analysis patterns”\n.\n47.4.1\nSCA command line tool\n#\nThe SCA command line tool lets you analyze a local machine using both\nsupportconfig\nand the analysis patterns for the specific\n    product that is installed on the local machine. The tool creates an HTML\n    report showing its analysis results. For an example, see\nFigure 47.1, “HTML report generated by SCA tool”\n.\nFigure 47.1:\nHTML report generated by SCA tool\n#\nThe\nscatool\ncommand is provided by the\nsca-server-report\npackage. It is\n    not installed by default. Additionally, you need the\nsca-patterns-base\npackage and any\n    of the product-specific\nsca-patterns-*\npackages that\n    matches the product installed on the machine where you want to run the\nscatool\ncommand.\nExecute the\nscatool\ncommand either as\nroot\nuser or\n    with\nsudo\n. When calling the SCA tool, either\n    analyze an existing\nsupportconfig\nTAR archive or\n    let it generate and analyze a new archive in one go. The tool also provides\n    an interactive console with tab completion. It is possible to run\nsupportconfig\non an external machine and to execute the\n    subsequent analysis on the local machine.\nFind some example commands below:\nsudo scatool\n-s\nCalls\nsupportconfig\nand generates a new Supportconfig\n       archive on the local machine. Analyzes the archive for known issues by\n       applying the SCA analysis patterns that match the installed product.\n       Displays the path to the HTML report that is generated from the results\n       of the analysis. It is usually written to the same directory where the\n       Supportconfig archive can be found.\nsudo scatool\n-s\n-o\n/opt/sca/reports/\nSame as\nsudo scatool\n-s\n, only that\n       the HTML report is written to the path specified with\n-o\n.\nsudo scatool\n-a\nPATH_TO_TARBALL_OR_DIR\nAnalyzes the specified Supportconfig archive file (or the specified\n       directory to where the Supportconfig archive has been extracted). The\n       generated HTML report is saved in the same location as the Supportconfig\n       archive or directory.\nsudo scatool\n-a\nSLES_SERVER.COMPANY.COM\nEstablishes an SSH connection to an external server\nSLES_SERVER.COMPANY.COM\nand runs\nsupportconfig\non the server. The Supportconfig\n       archive is then copied back to the local machine and is analyzed there.\n       The generated HTML report is saved to the default\n/var/log\ndirectory. (Only the Supportconfig archive\n       is created on\nSLES_SERVER.COMPANY.COM\n).\nsudo scatool\n-c\nStarts the interactive console for\nscatool\n. Press\n→|\ntwice to see the available commands.\nFor further options and information, run\nsudo scatool -h\nor see the\nscatool\nman page.\n47.4.2\nSCA appliance\n#\nIf you decide to use the SCA appliance for analyzing the Supportconfig\n    archives, configure a dedicated server (or virtual machine) as\n    the SCA appliance server. The SCA appliance server can then be used to\n    analyze Supportconfig archives from all machines in your enterprise running\n    SUSE Linux Enterprise Server or SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop. You can simply upload Supportconfig archives to the\n    appliance server for analysis. Interaction is not required. In a MariaDB\n    database, the SCA appliance keeps track of all Supportconfig archives that\n    have been analyzed . You can read the SCA reports directly from the\n    appliance Web interface. Alternatively, you can have the appliance send the\n    HTML report to any administrative user via e-mail. For details, see\nSection 47.4.2.5.4, “Sending SCA reports via e-mail”\n.\n47.4.2.1\nInstallation quick start\n#\nTo install and set up the SCA appliance in a very fast way from the\n     command line, follow the instructions here. The procedure is intended for\n     experts and focuses on the bare installation and setup commands. For more\n     information, refer to the more detailed description in\nSection 47.4.2.2, “Prerequisites”\nto\nSection 47.4.2.3, “Installation and basic setup”\n.\nPrerequisites\n#\nWeb and LAMP Pattern\nWeb and Scripting Module (you must register the machine to be able to\n       select this module).\nNote:\nroot\nprivileges required\nAll commands in the following procedure must be run as\nroot\n.\nProcedure 47.3:\nInstallation using anonymous FTP for upload\n#\nAfter the appliance is set up and running, no more manual interaction is\n      required. This way of setting up the appliance is therefore ideal for\n      using cron jobs to create and upload Supportconfig archives.\nOn the machine on which to install the appliance, log in to a console\n       and execute the following commands (make sure to accept the recommended packages):\n>\nsudo\nzypper install sca-appliance-* sca-patterns-* \\\nvsftpd yast2 yast2-ftp-server\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl enable apache2\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl start apache2\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl enable vsftpd\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl start vsftpd\n>\nsudo\nyast ftp-server\nIn YaST FTP Server, select\nAuthentication\n›\nEnable Upload\n›\nAnonymous Can Upload\n›\nFinish\n›\nYes\nto\nCreate\n       /srv/ftp/upload\n.\nExecute the following commands:\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl enable mysql\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl start mysql\n>\nsudo\nmysql_secure_installation\n>\nsudo\nsetup-sca -f\nThe mysql_secure_installation will create a MariaDB\nroot\npassword.\nProcedure 47.4:\nInstallation using SCP/tmp for upload\n#\nThis way of setting up the appliance requires manual interaction when\n      typing the SSH password.\nOn the machine on which to install the appliance, log in to a console.\nExecute the following commands:\n>\nsudo\nzypper install sca-appliance-* sca-patterns-*\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl enable apache2\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl start apache2\n>\nsudo\nsudo systemctl enable mysql\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl start mysql\n>\nsudo\nmysql_secure_installation\n>\nsudo\nsetup-sca\n47.4.2.2\nPrerequisites\n#\nTo run an SCA appliance server, you need the following prerequisites:\nAll\nsca-appliance-*\npackages.\nThe\nsca-patterns-base\npackage.\n       Additionally, any of the product-specific\nsca-patterns-*\nfor the type of\n       Supportconfig archives that you want to analyze with the appliance.\nApache\nPHP\nMariaDB\nanonymous FTP server (optional)\n47.4.2.3\nInstallation and basic setup\n#\nAs listed in\nSection 47.4.2.2, “Prerequisites”\n, the SCA\n     appliance has several dependencies on other packages. Therefore you need\n     do so some preparations before installing and setting up the SCA appliance\n     server:\nFor Apache and MariaDB, install the\nWeb\nand\nLAMP\ninstallation patterns.\nSet up Apache, MariaDB, and optionally an anonymous FTP server.\nFor more information, see\nChapter 42,\nThe Apache HTTP server\nand\nChapter 43,\nSetting up an FTP server with YaST\n.\nConfigure Apache and MariaDB to start at boot time:\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl enable apache2 mysql\nStart both services:\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl start apache2 mysql\nNow you can install the SCA appliance and set it up as described in\nProcedure 47.5, “Installing and configuring the SCA appliance”\n.\nProcedure 47.5:\nInstalling and configuring the SCA appliance\n#\nAfter installing the packages, use the\nsetup-sca\nscript for the basic configuration of the MariaDB administration and\n      report database that is used by the SCA appliance.\nIt can be used to configure the following options you have for uploading\n      the Supportconfig archives from your machines to the SCA appliance:\nscp\nanonymous FTP server\nInstall the appliance and the SCA base-pattern library:\n>\nsudo\nzypper install sca-appliance-* sca-patterns-base\nAdditionally, install the pattern packages for the types of\n       Supportconfig archives you want to analyze. For example, if you have\n       SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 servers in your environment, install both the\nsca-patterns-sle12\nand\nsca-patterns-sle15\npackages.\nTo install all available patterns:\n>\nsudo\nzypper install sca-patterns-*\nFor basic setup of the SCA appliance, use the\nsetup-sca\nscript. How to call it depends on how you\n       want to upload the Supportconfig archives to the SCA appliance server:\nIf you have configured an anonymous FTP server that uses the\n/srv/ftp/upload\ndirectory, execute the setup\n         script with the\n-f\noption. Follow the instructions\n         on the screen:\n>\nsudo\nsetup-sca -f\nNote: FTP server using another directory\nIf your FTP server uses another directory than\n/srv/ftp/upload\n, adjust the following\n          configuration files first to make them point to the correct\n          directory:\n/etc/sca/sdagent.conf\nand\n/etc/sca/sdbroker.conf\n.\nIf you want to upload Supportconfig files to the\n/tmp\ndirectory of the SCA appliance server via\nscp\n, call the setup script without any parameters.\n         Follow the instructions on the screen:\n>\nsudo\nsetup-sca\nThe setup script runs a few checks regarding its requirements and\n       configures the needed components. It will prompt you for two passwords:\n       the MySQL\nroot\npassword of the MariaDB that you have set up, and a\n       Web user password with which to log in to the Web interface of the SCA\n       appliance.\nEnter the existing MariaDB\nroot\npassword. It will allow the SCA\n       appliance to connect to the MariaDB.\nDefine a password for the Web user. It will be written to\n/srv/www/htdocs/sca/web-config.php\nand will be set\n       as the password for the user\nscdiag\n. Both user name and\n       password can be changed at any time later, see\nSection 47.4.2.5.1, “Password for the Web interface”\n.\nAfter successful installation and setup, the SCA appliance is ready for\n     use, see\nSection 47.4.2.4, “Using the SCA appliance”\n. However, you\n     should modify some options such as changing the password for the Web\n     interface, changing the source for the SCA pattern updates, enabling\n     archiving mode or configuring e-mail notifications. For details on that,\n     see\nSection 47.4.2.5, “Customizing the SCA appliance”\n.\nWarning: Data protection\nAs the reports on the SCA appliance server contain security-relevant\n      information, make sure to protect the data on the SCA appliance server\n      against unauthorized access.\n47.4.2.4\nUsing the SCA appliance\n#\nYou can upload existing Supportconfig archives to the SCA appliance\n     manually or create new Supportconfig archives and upload them to the SCA\n     appliance in one step. Uploading can be done via FTP or SCP. For both, you\n     need to know the URL where the SCA appliance can be reached. For upload\n     via FTP, an FTP server needs to be configured for the SCA appliance, see\nProcedure 47.5, “Installing and configuring the SCA appliance”\n.\n47.4.2.4.1\nUploading supportconfig archives to the SCA appliance\n#\nFor creating a Supportconfig archive and uploading it via (anonymous)\n        FTP:\n>\nsudo\nsupportconfig -U “ftp://\nSCA-APPLIANCE.COMPANY.COM\n/upload”\nFor creating a Supportconfig archive and uploading it via SCP:\n>\nsudo\nsupportconfig -U “scp://\nSCA-APPLIANCE.COMPANY.COM\n/tmp”\nYou will be prompted for the\nroot\nuser password of the server\n        running the SCA appliance.\nIf you want to manually upload one or multiple archives, copy the\n        existing archive files (usually located\n        at\n/var/log/scc_*.tbz\n) to the SCA appliance. As\n        target, use either the appliance server's\n/tmp\ndirectory or the\n/srv/ftp/upload\ndirectory (if FTP\n        is configured for the SCA appliance server).\n47.4.2.4.2\nViewing SCA reports\n#\nSCA reports can be viewed from any machine that has a browser installed\n      and can access the report index page of the SCA appliance.\nStart a Web browser and make sure that JavaScript and cookies are\n        enabled.\nAs a URL, enter the report index page of the SCA appliance.\nhttps://sca-appliance.company.com/sca\nIf in doubt, ask your system administrator.\nYou will be prompted for a user name and a password to log in.\nFigure 47.2:\nHTML report generated by SCA appliance\n#\nAfter logging in, click the date of the report you want to read.\nClick the\nBasic Health\ncategory first to expand it.\nIn the\nMessage\ncolumn, click an individual entry.\n\n        This opens the corresponding article in the SUSE Knowledge base. Read\n        the proposed solution and follow the instructions.\nIf the\nSolutions\ncolumn of the\nSupportconfig Analysis Report\nshows any additional\n        entries, click them. Read the proposed solution and follow the\n        instructions.\nCheck the SUSE Knowledge base\n        (\nhttps://www.suse.com/support/kb/\n) for results that\n        directly relate to the problem identified by SCA. Work at resolving\n        them.\nCheck for results that can be addressed proactively to avoid future\n        problems.\n47.4.2.5\nCustomizing the SCA appliance\n#\nThe following sections show how to change the password for the Web\n     interface, how to change the source for the SCA pattern updates, how to\n     enable archiving mode, and how to configure e-mail notifications.\n47.4.2.5.1\nPassword for the Web interface\n#\nThe SCA Appliance Web interface requires a user name and password for\n      logging in. The default user name is\nscdiag\nand the\n      default password is\nlinux\n(if not specified otherwise,\n      see\nProcedure 47.5, “Installing and configuring the SCA appliance”\n). Change the default password\n      to a secure password at the earliest possibility. You can also modify the\n      user name.\nProcedure 47.6:\nChanging user name or password for the Web interface\n#\nLog in as\nroot\nuser at the system console of the SCA appliance\n        server.\nOpen\n/srv/www/htdocs/sca/web-config.php\nin an\n        editor.\nChange the values of\n$username\nand\n$password\nas desired.\nSave the file and exit.\n47.4.2.5.2\nUpdates of SCA patterns\n#\nBy default, all\nsca-patterns-*\npackages are updated regularly by a\nroot\ncron job that executes the\nsdagent-patterns\nscript nightly, which in turn runs\nzypper update sca-patterns-*\n. A regular system update\n      will update all SCA appliance and pattern packages. To update the SCA\n      appliance and patterns manually, run:\n>\nsudo\nzypper update sca-*\nThe updates are installed from the SUSE Linux Enterprise\n15 SP4\nupdate\n      repository by default. You can change the source for the updates to an\n      RMT server, if desired. When\nsdagent-patterns\nruns\nzypper update sca-patterns-*\n, it gets the updates from\n      the currently configured update channel. If that channel is located on an\n      RMT server, the packages will be pulled from there.\nProcedure 47.7:\nDisabling automatic updates of SCA patterns\n#\nLog in as\nroot\nuser at the system console of the SCA appliance\n        server.\nOpen\n/etc/sca/sdagent-patterns.conf\nin an editor.\nChange the entry\nUPDATE_FROM_PATTERN_REPO=1\nto\nUPDATE_FROM_PATTERN_REPO=0\nSave the file and exit. The machine does not require any restart to\n        apply the change.\n47.4.2.5.3\nArchiving mode\n#\nAll Supportconfig archives are deleted from the SCA appliance after they\n      have been analyzed and their results have been stored in the MariaDB\n      database. However, for troubleshooting purposes it can be useful to keep\n      copies of Supportconfig archives from a machine. By default, archiving\n      mode is disabled.\nProcedure 47.8:\nEnabling archiving mode in the SCA appliance\n#\nLog in as\nroot\nuser at the system console of the SCA appliance\n        server.\nOpen\n/etc/sca/sdagent.conf\nin an editor.\nChange the entry\nARCHIVE_MODE=0\nto\nARCHIVE_MODE=1\nSave the file and exit. The machine does not require any restart to\n        apply the change.\nAfter having enabled archive mode, the SCA appliance will save the\n      Supportconfig files to the\n/var/log/archives/saved\ndirectory, instead of deleting them.\n47.4.2.5.4\nSending SCA reports via e-mail\n#\nThe SCA appliance can e-mail a report HTML file for each Supportconfig\n      analyzed. This feature is disabled by default. When enabling it, you can\n      define a list of e-mail addresses to which the reports should be sent.\n      Define a level of status messages that trigger the sending of reports\n      (\nSTATUS_NOTIFY_LEVEL\n).\nPossible values for\nSTATUS_NOTIFY_LEVEL\n#\n$STATUS_OFF\nDeactivate sending of HTML reports.\n$STATUS_CRITICAL\nSend only SCA reports that include a CRITICAL.\n$STATUS_WARNING\nSend only SCA reports that include a WARNING or CRITICAL.\n$STATUS_RECOMMEND\nSend only SCA reports that include a RECOMMEND, WARNING or CRITICAL.\n$STATUS_SUCCESS\nSend SCA reports that include a SUCCESS, RECOMMEND, WARNING or\n         CRITICAL.\nProcedure 47.9:\nConfiguring e-mail notifications for SCA reports\n#\nLog in as\nroot\nuser at the system console of the SCA appliance\n        server.\nOpen\n/etc/sca/sdagent.conf\nin an editor.\nSearch for the entry\nSTATUS_NOTIFY_LEVEL\n. By\n        default, it is set to\n$STATUS_OFF\n(e-mail\n        notifications are disabled).\nTo enable e-mail notifications, change\n$STATUS_OFF\nto the level of status messages that you want to have e-mail reports\n        for, for example:\nSTATUS_NOTIFY_LEVEL=$STATUS_SUCCESS\nFor details, see\nPossible values for\nSTATUS_NOTIFY_LEVEL\n.\nTo define the list of recipients to which the reports should be sent:\nSearch for the entry\nEMAIL_REPORT='root'\n.\nReplace\nroot\nwith a list of e-mail addresses to\n          which SCA reports should be sent. The e-mail addresses must be\n          separated by spaces. For example:\nEMAIL_REPORT='tux@my.company.com wilber@your.company.com'\nSave the file and exit. The machine does not require any restart to\n        apply the changes. All future SCA reports will be e-mailed to the\n        specified addresses.\n47.4.2.6\nBacking up and restoring the database\n#\nTo back up and restore the MariaDB database that stores the SCA reports,\n     use the\nscadb\ncommand as described\n     below.\nscadb\nis provided by the package\nsca-appliance-broker\n.\nProcedure 47.10:\nBacking up the database\n#\nLog in as\nroot\nuser at the system console of the server running\n       the SCA appliance.\nPut the appliance into maintenance mode by executing:\n#\nscadb maint\nStart the backup with:\n#\nscadb backup\nThe data is saved to a TAR archive:\nsca-backup-*sql.gz\n.\nIf you are using the pattern creation database to develop your own\n       patterns (see\nSection 47.4.3, “Developing custom analysis patterns”\n), back up\n       this data, too:\n#\nsdpdb backup\nThe data is saved to a TAR archive:\nsdp-backup-*sql.gz\n.\nCopy the following data to another machine or an external storage\n       medium:\nsca-backup-*sql.gz\nsdp-backup-*sql.gz\n/usr/lib/sca/patterns/local\n(only needed if you\n         have created custom patterns)\nReactivate the SCA appliance with:\n#\nscadb reset agents\nProcedure 47.11:\nRestoring the database\n#\nTo restore the database from your backup, proceed as follows:\nLog in as\nroot\nuser at the system console of the server running\n       the SCA appliance.\nCopy the newest\nsca-backup-*sql.gz\nand\nsdp-backup-*sql.gz\nTAR archives to the SCA\n       appliance server.\nTo decompress the files, run:\n#\ngzip -d *-backup-*sql.gz\nTo import the data into the database, execute:\n#\nscadb import sca-backup-*sql\nIf you are using the pattern creation database to create your own\n       patterns, also import the following data with:\n#\nsdpdb import sdp-backup-*sql\nIf you are using custom patterns, also restore\n/usr/lib/sca/patterns/local\nfrom your backup data.\nReactivate the SCA appliance with:\n#\nscadb reset agents\nUpdate the pattern modules in the database with:\n#\nsdagent-patterns -u\n47.4.3\nDeveloping custom analysis patterns\n#\nThe SCA appliance comes with a complete pattern development environment\n    (the SCA Pattern Database) that enables you to develop your own, custom\n    patterns. Patterns can be written in any programming language. To make them\n    available for the Supportconfig analysis process, they need to be saved to\n/usr/lib/sca/patterns/local\nand to be made executable.\n    Both the SCA appliance and the SCA tool will then run the custom patterns\n    against new Supportconfig archives as part of the analysis report. For\n    detailed instructions on how to create (and test) your own patterns, see\nhttps://www.suse.com/c/blog/sca-pattern-development/\n.\n47.5\nGathering information during the installation\n#\nDuring the installation,\nsupportconfig\nis not available.\n   However, you can collect log files from YaST by using\nsave_y2logs\n. This command will create a\n.tar.xz\narchive in the directory\n/tmp\n.\nIf issues appear very early during installation, you may be able to gather\n   information from the log file created by\nlinuxrc\n.\nlinuxrc\nis a small command\n   that runs before YaST starts. This log file is available at\n/var/log/linuxrc.log\n.\nImportant: Installation log files not available in the installed system\nThe log files available during the installation are not available in the\n    installed system anymore. Properly save the installation log files while\n    the installer is still running.\n47.6\nSupport of kernel modules\n#\nAn important requirement for every enterprise operating system is the level\n   of support you receive for your environment. Kernel modules are the most\n   relevant connector between hardware (\n“\ncontrollers\n”\n) and the\n   operating system. Every kernel module in SUSE Linux Enterprise has a\nsupported\nflag that can take three possible values:\n“\nyes\n”\n, thus\nsupported\n“\nexternal\n”\n, thus\nsupported\n“\n(empty, not set)\n”\n, thus\nunsupported\nThe following rules apply:\nAll modules of a self-recompiled kernel are by default marked as\n     unsupported.\nKernel modules supported by SUSE partners and delivered using\nSUSE SolidDriver Program\nare marked\n“\nexternal\n”\n.\nIf the\nsupported\nflag is not set, loading this module\n     will taint the kernel. Tainted kernels are not supported. Unsupported\n     Kernel modules are included in an extra RPM package\n     (\nkernel-\nFLAVOR\n-extra\n).\n     That package is only available for SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop and the SUSE Linux Enterprise Workstation Extension.\n     Those kernels will not be loaded by default\n     (\nFLAVOR\n=\ndefault\n|\nxen\n|...).\n     In addition, these unsupported modules are not available in the installer,\n     and the\nkernel-\nFLAVOR\n-extra\npackage is not part of the SUSE Linux Enterprise media.\nKernel modules not provided under a license compatible to the license of\n     the Linux kernel also taint the kernel. For details, see the state of\n/proc/sys/kernel/tainted\n.\n47.6.1\nTechnical background\n#\nLinux kernel: The value of\n/proc/sys/kernel/unsupported\ndefaults to\n2\non SUSE Linux Enterprise\n15 SP4\n(\ndo not warn in\n      syslog when loading unsupported modules\n). This default is used\n      in the installer and in the installed system.\nmodprobe\n: The\nmodprobe\nutility for\n      checking module dependencies and loading modules appropriately checks for\n      the value of the\nsupported\nflag. If the value is\n“\nyes\n”\nor\n“\nexternal\n”\nthe module will be loaded,\n      otherwise it will not. For information on how to override this behavior,\n      see\nSection 47.6.2, “Working with unsupported modules”\n.\nNote: Support\nSUSE does not generally support the removal of storage modules via\nmodprobe -r\n.\n47.6.2\nWorking with unsupported modules\n#\nWhile general supportability is important, situations can occur where\n    loading an unsupported module is required. For example, for testing or\n    debugging purposes, or if your hardware vendor provides a hotfix.\nTo override the default, copy\n/lib/modprobe.d/10-unsupported-modules.conf\nto\n/etc/modprobe.d/10-unsupported-modules.conf\nand\n      change the value of the variable\nallow_unsupported_modules\nfrom\n0\nto\n1\n. Do not edit\n/lib/modprobe.d/10-unsupported-modules.conf\ndirectly;\n      any changes will be overwritten whenever the\nsuse-module-tools\npackage is updated.\nIf an unsupported module is needed in the initrd, do not forget to run\ndracut\n-f\nto update the initrd.\nIf you only want to try loading a module once, you can use the\n--allow-unsupported-modules\noption with\nmodprobe\n. For more information, see the comments in\n/lib/modprobe.d/10-unsupported-modules.conf\nand the\nmodprobe\nman page.\nDuring installation, unsupported modules may be added through driver\n      update disks, and they will be loaded. To enforce loading of unsupported\n      modules during boot and afterward, use the kernel command line option\noem-modules\n. While installing and initializing the\nsuse-module-tools\npackage, the\n      kernel flag\nTAINT_NO_SUPPORT\n(\n/proc/sys/kernel/tainted\n) will be evaluated. If the\n      kernel is already tainted,\nallow_unsupported_modules\nwill be enabled. This will prevent unsupported modules from failing in\n      the system being installed. If no unsupported modules are present during\n      installation and the other special kernel command line option\n      (\noem-modules=1\n) is not used, the default still is to\n      disallow unsupported modules.\nRemember that loading and running unsupported modules will make the kernel\n    and the whole system unsupported by SUSE.\n47.7\nMore information\n#\nman supportconfig\n—The\nsupportconfig\nman page.\nman supportconfig.conf\n—The man page of the\n     Supportconfig configuration file.\nman scatool\n—The\nscatool\nman\n     page.\nman scadb\n—The\nscadb\nman page.\nman setup-sca\n—The\nsetup-sca\nman page.\nhttps://mariadb.com/kb/en/\n—The MariaDB\n     documentation.\nhttp://httpd.apache.org/docs/\nand\nChapter 42,\nThe Apache HTTP server\n—Documentation about the Apache Web\n     server.\nChapter 43,\nSetting up an FTP server with YaST\n—Documentation of how to set up an FTP\n     server.\nhttps://www.suse.com/c/blog/sca-pattern-development/\n—Instructions\n     on how to create (and test) your own SCA patterns.\nhttps://www.suse.com/c/blog/basic-server-health-check-supportconfig/\n—A\n     Basic Server Health Check with Supportconfig.\nhttps://community.microfocus.com/img/gw/groupwise/w/groupwise/34308/create-your-own-supportconfig-plugin\n—Create\n     Your Own Supportconfig Plugin.\nhttps://www.suse.com/c/blog/creating-a-central-supportconfig-repository/\n—Creating\n     a Central Supportconfig Repository.\nOn this page\n47.1\nDisplaying current system information\n47.2\nCollecting system information with supportconfig\n47.3\nSubmitting information to Global Technical Support\n47.4\nAnalyzing system information\n47.5\nGathering information during the installation\n47.6\nSupport of kernel modules\n47.7\nMore information\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

There are several places to\n   look when you encounter problems with your system, most of which are\n   standard to Linux systems in general, and some are relevant to\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nsystems. Most log files can be viewed with YaST (\nMiscellaneous\n›\nStart-Up Log\n).\nYaST offers the possibility to collect all system information\n   needed by the support team. Use\nOther\n›\nSupport\nand select\n   the problem category. When all information is gathered, attach it to your\n   support request.\nA list of the most frequently checked log files follows with the description\n   of their typical purpose. Paths containing\n~\nrefer to\n   the current user's home directory.\nTable 48.1:\nLog files\n#\nLog File\nDescription\n~/.xsession-errors\nMessages from the desktop applications currently running.\n/var/log/apparmor/\nLog files from AppArmor, see\nPart V, “Confining privileges with\nAppArmor\n”\nfor detailed information.\n/var/log/audit/audit.log\nLog file from Audit to track any access to files, directories,\n                or resources of your system, and trace system calls. See\nPart VII, “The Linux Audit Framework”\nfor detailed information.\n/var/log/mail.*\nMessages from the mail system.\n/var/log/NetworkManager\nLog file from NetworkManager to collect problems with network\n                connectivity\n/var/log/samba/\nDirectory containing Samba server and client log messages.\n/var/log/warn\nAll messages from the kernel and system log daemon with the\n“\nwarning\n”\nlevel or higher.\n/var/log/wtmp\nBinary file containing user login records for the current\n                machine session.

It is useful for debugging failed X start-ups.\n/var/log/YaST2/\nDirectory containing YaST's actions and their results.\n/var/log/zypper.log\nLog file of Zypper.\nApart from log files, your machine also supplies you with information about\n   the running system. See\nTable 48.2: System information with the\n/proc\nfile system\nTable 48.2:\nSystem information with the\n/proc\nfile system\n#\nFile\nDescription\n/proc/cpuinfo\nContains processor information, including its type, make, model, and\n        performance.\n/proc/dma\nShows which DMA channels are currently being used.\n/proc/interrupts\nShows which interrupts are in use, and how many of each have been in\n        use.\n/proc/iomem\nDisplays the status of I/O (input/output) memory.\n/proc/ioports\nShows which I/O ports are in use at the moment.\n/proc/meminfo\nDisplays memory status.\n/proc/modules\nDisplays the individual modules.\n/proc/mounts\nDisplays devices currently mounted.\n/proc/partitions\nShows the partitioning of all hard disks.\n/proc/version\nDisplays the current version of Linux.\nApart from the\n/proc\nfile system, the Linux kernel\n   exports information with the\nsysfs\nmodule, an in-memory\n   file system. This module represents kernel objects, their attributes and\n   relationships. For more information about\nsysfs\n, see the\n   context of udev in\nChapter 29,\nDynamic kernel device management with\nudev\n.\nTable 48.3\ncontains\n   an overview of the most common directories under\n/sys\n.\nTable 48.3:\nSystem information with the\n/sys\nfile system\n#\nFile\nDescription\n/sys/block\nContains subdirectories for each block device discovered in the system.\n        Generally, these are mostly disk type devices.\n/sys/bus\nContains subdirectories for each physical bus type.\n/sys/class\nContains subdirectories grouped together as a functional types of\n        devices (like graphics, net, printer, etc.)\n/sys/device\nContains the global device hierarchy.\nLinux comes with several tools for system analysis and monitoring. See\nChapter 2,\nSystem monitoring utilities\nfor a selection of the most important ones used\n   in system diagnostics.\nEach of the following scenarios begins with a header describing the problem\n   followed by a paragraph or two offering suggested solutions, available\n   references for more detailed solutions, and cross-references to other\n   scenarios that are related.\n48.2\nBoot problems\n#\nBoot problems are situations when your system does not boot properly (does\n   not boot to the expected target and login screen).\n48.2.1\nThe GRUB 2 boot loader fails to load\n#\nIf the hardware is functioning properly, it is possible that the boot\n    loader is corrupted and Linux cannot start on the machine. In this case, it\n    is necessary to repair the boot loader. To do so, you need to start the\n    Rescue System as described in\nSection 48.5.2, “Using the rescue system”\nand follow the\n    instructions in\nSection 48.5.2.4, “Modifying and re-installing the boot loader”\n.\nAlternatively, you can use the Rescue System to fix the boot loader as\n    follows. Boot your machine from the installation media. In the boot screen,\n    choose\nMore\n›\nBoot Linux\n    System\n. Select the disk containing the installed\n    system and kernel with the default kernel options.\nWhen the system is booted, start YaST and switch to\nSystem\n›\nBoot\n    Loader\n. Make sure that the\nWrite generic\n    Boot Code to MBR\noption is enabled, and click\nOK\n. This fixes the corrupted boot loader by overwriting\n    it, or installs the boot loader if it is missing.\nOther reasons for the machine not booting may be BIOS-related:\nBIOS settings\nCheck your BIOS for references to your hard disk. GRUB 2 may simply not\n       be started if the hard disk itself cannot be found with the current BIOS\n       settings.\nBIOS boot order\nCheck whether your system's boot order includes the hard disk. If the\n       hard disk option was not enabled, your system may install properly, but\n       fails to boot when access to the hard disk is required.\n48.2.2\nNo graphical login\n#\nIf the machine starts, but does not boot into the graphical login\n    manager, anticipate problems either with the choice of the default systemd\n    target or the configuration of the X Window System. To check the current\n    systemd default target run the command\nsudo systemctl\n    get-default\n. If the value returned is\nnot\ngraphical.target\n, run the command\nsudo\n    systemctl isolate graphical.target\n. If the graphical login screen\n    starts, log in and start\nYaST\n›\nSystem\n›\nServices Manager\nand set the\nDefault System Target\nto\nGraphical\n    Interface\n. From now on the system should boot into the graphical\n    login screen.\nIf the graphical login screen does not start even if having booted or\n    switched to the graphical target, your desktop or X Window software is\n    probably misconfigured or corrupted. Examine the log files at\n/var/log/Xorg.*.log\nfor detailed messages from the X\n    server as it attempted to start. If the desktop fails during start, it may\n    log error messages to the system journal that can be queried with the\n    command\njournalctl\n(see\nChapter 21,\njournalctl\n: Query the\nsystemd\njournal\nfor more information). If these error messages hint at a configuration\n    problem in the X server, try to fix these issues. If the graphical system\n    still does not come up, consider reinstalling the graphical desktop.\n48.2.3\nRoot Btrfs partition cannot be mounted\n#\nIf a\nbtrfs\nroot partition\n    becomes corrupted, try the following options:\nMount the partition with the\n-o recovery\noption.\nIf that fails, run\nbtrfs-zero-log\non your root\n      partition.\n48.2.4\nForce checking root partitions\n#\nIf the root partition becomes corrupted, use the parameter\nforcefsck\non the boot prompt. This passes the option\n-f\n(force) to the\nfsck\ncommand.\n48.2.5\nDisable swap to enable booting\n#\nWhen a swap device is not available and the system cannot enable it\n          during boot, booting may fail. Try disabling all swap devices by\n          appending the following options to the kernel command line:\nsystemd.device_wants_unit=off systemd.mask=swap.target\nYou may also try disabling specific swap devices:\nsystemd.mask=dev-sda1.swap\n48.2.6\nGRUB 2 fails during reboot on a dual-boot\n    system\n#\nIf GRUB 2 fails during reboot, disable the\nFast Boot\nsetting in the BIOS.\n48.3\nLogin problems\n#\nLogin problems occur when your system refuses to accept the user name and\n      password, or accepts them but then fails to start the graphic desktop,\n      produces errors, or drops to a command line, for example.\n48.3.1\nValid user name and password combinations fail\n#\nThis often occurs when the system is configured to use network\n        authentication or directory services and cannot retrieve results from\n        its configured servers. The\nroot\nuser is the only local user that\n        can still log in to these machines. The following\n        are common reasons a machine appears functional but cannot process\n        logins correctly:\nThe network is not working. For further directions on this, turn to\nSection 48.4, “Network problems”\n.\nDNS is not working at the moment (which prevents GNOME from\n            working and the system from making validated requests to secure\n            servers). One indication that this is the case is that the machine\n            takes a long time to respond to any action. Find more information\n            about this topic in\nSection 48.4, “Network problems”\n.\nIf the system is configured to use Kerberos, the system's local\n            time may have drifted past the accepted variance with the Kerberos\n            server time (this is typically 300 seconds). If NTP (network time\n            protocol) is not working properly or local NTP servers are not\n            working, Kerberos authentication ceases to function because it\n            depends on common clock synchronization across the network.\nThe system's authentication configuration is misconfigured. Check\n            the PAM configuration files involved for any typographical errors\n            or misordering of directives. For additional background information\n            about PAM and the syntax of the configuration files involved, refer\n            to\nChapter 2,\nAuthentication with PAM\n.\nThe home partition is encrypted. Find more information about this\n            topic in\nSection 48.3.3, “Login to encrypted home partition fails”\n.\nIn cases that do not involve external network problems, the solution is\n        to log in as\nroot\nand repair the configuration. If you cannot log\n        in to the running system, reboot it into the rescue mode as outlined in\nProcedure 18.3, “Entering rescue mode”\n.\n48.3.2\nValid user name and password not accepted\n#\nThis is by far the most common problem users encounter, because there\n        are many reasons this can occur. Depending on whether you use local\n        user management and authentication or network authentication, login\n        failures occur for different reasons.\nLocal user management can fail for the following reasons:\nThe user may have entered the wrong password.\nThe user's home directory containing the desktop configuration\n            files is corrupted or write protected.\nThere may be problems with the X Window System authenticating this\n            particular user, especially if the user's home directory has been\n            used with another Linux distribution before installing the current\n            one.\nTo locate the reason for a local login failure, proceed as follows:\nCheck whether the user remembered their password correctly before\n            you start debugging the whole authentication mechanism. If the user\n            may have not have remembered their password correctly, use the\n            YaST User Management module to change the user's password. Pay\n            attention to the\nCaps Lock\nkey and unlock it, if\n            necessary.\nLog in as\nroot\nand check the system journal with\njournalctl -e\nfor error messages of the login\n            process and of PAM.\nTry to log in from a console (using\nCtrl\n–\nAlt\n–\nF1\n). If this is successful, the blame\n            cannot be put on PAM, because it is possible to authenticate this\n            user on this machine. Try to locate any problems with the X Window\n            System or the GNOME desktop. For more information, refer to\nSection 48.3.4, “GNOME desktop has issues”\n.\nIf the user's home directory has been used with another Linux\n            distribution, remove the\nXauthority\nfile in\n            the user's home. Use a console login via\nCtrl\n–\nAlt\n–\nF1\nand run\nrm\n            .Xauthority\nas this user. This should eliminate X\n            authentication problems for this user. Try graphical login again.\nIf the desktop could not start because of corrupt configuration\n            files, proceed with\nSection 48.3.4, “GNOME desktop has issues”\n.\nIn the following, common reasons a network authentication for a\n        particular user may fail on a specific machine are listed:\nThe user may have entered the wrong password.\nThe user name exists in the machine's local authentication files\n            and is also provided by a network authentication system, causing\n            conflicts.\nThe home directory exists but is corrupt or unavailable. Perhaps it\n            is write protected or is on a server that is inaccessible at the\n            moment.\nThe user does not have permission to log in to that particular host\n            in the authentication system.\nThe machine has changed host names, for whatever reason, and the\n            user does not have permission to log in to that host.\nThe machine cannot reach the authentication server or directory\n            server that contains that user's information.\nThere may be problems with the X Window System authenticating this\n            particular user, especially if the user's home has been used with\n            another Linux distribution before installing the current one.\nTo locate the cause of the login failures with network authentication,\n        proceed as follows:\nCheck whether the user remembered their password correctly before\n            you start debugging the whole authentication mechanism.\nDetermine the directory server which the machine relies on for\n            authentication and make sure that it is up and running and properly\n            communicating with the other machines.\nDetermine that the user's user name and password work on other\n            machines to make sure that their authentication data exists and is\n            properly distributed.\nSee if another user can log in to the misbehaving machine. If\n            another user can log in without difficulty or if\nroot\ncan log\n            in, log in and examine the system journal with the\njournalctl\n            -e\n> file. Locate the time stamps that correspond to\n            the login attempts and determine if PAM has produced any error\n            messages.\nTry to log in from a console (using\nCtrl\n–\nAlt\n–\nF1\n). If this is successful, the\n            problem is not with PAM or the directory server on which the user's\n            home is hosted, because it is possible to authenticate this user on\n            this machine. Try to locate any problems with the X Window System\n            or the GNOME desktop. For more information, refer to\nSection 48.3.4, “GNOME desktop has issues”\n.\nIf the user's home directory has been used with another Linux\n            distribution, remove the\nXauthority\nfile in\n            the user's home. Use a console login via\nCtrl\n–\nAlt\n–\nF1\nand run\nrm\n            .Xauthority\nas this user. This should eliminate X\n            authentication problems for this user. Try graphical login again.\nIf the desktop could not start because of corrupt configuration\n            files, proceed with\nSection 48.3.4, “GNOME desktop has issues”\n.\n48.3.3\nLogin to encrypted home partition fails\n#\nIt is recommended to use an encrypted home partition for laptops. If\n        you cannot log in to your laptop, the reason might be that your\n        partition could not be unlocked.\nDuring the boot time, you need to enter the passphrase to unlock your\n        encrypted partition. If you do not enter it, the boot process\n        continues, leaving the partition locked.\nTo unlock your encrypted partition, proceed as follows:\nSwitch to the text console with\nCtrl\n–\nAlt\n–\nF1\n.\nBecome\nroot\n.\nRestart the unlocking process again with:\n#\nsystemctl restart home.mount\nEnter your passphrase to unlock your encrypted partition.\nExit the text console and switch back to the login screen with\nAlt\n–\nF7\n.\nLog in as usual.\n48.3.4\nGNOME desktop has issues\n#\nIf you are experiencing issues with the GNOME desktop, there\n     are several ways to troubleshoot the misbehaving graphical\n     desktop environment. The recommended procedure described below\n     offers the safest option to fix a broken GNOME desktop.\nProcedure 48.1:\nTroubleshooting GNOME\n#\nLaunch YaST and switch to\nSecurity and Users\n.\nOpen the\nUser and Group Management\ndialog and click\nAdd\n.\nFill out the required fields and click\nOK\nto create a new user.\nLog out and log in as the new user. This gives you a fresh\n\t  GNOME environment.\nCopy individual subdirectories from the\n~/.local/\nand\n~/.config/\ndirectories of the old user\n\t account to the respective directories of the new user\n\t account.\nLog out and log in again as the new user after every\n\t copy operation to check whether GNOME still works\n\t correctly.\nRepeat the previous step until you find the configuration file that\n\t breaks GNOME.\nLog in as the old user, and move the offending configuration\n\t file to a different location. Log out and log in again as the\n\t old user.\nDelete the previously created user.\n48.4\nNetwork problems\n#\nMany problems of your system may be network-related, even though they do not\n   seem to be at first. For example, the reason for a system not allowing users\n   to log in may be a network problem of some kind. This section introduces a\n   simple checklist you can apply to identify the cause of any network problem\n   encountered.\nProcedure 48.2:\nHow to identify network problems\n#\nWhen checking the network connection of your machine, proceed as follows:\nIf you use an Ethernet connection, check the hardware first. Make sure\n     that your network cable is properly plugged into your computer and router\n     (or hub, etc.). The control lights next to your Ethernet connector are\n     normally both be active.\nIf the connection fails, check whether your network cable works with\n     another machine. If it does, your network card causes the failure. If hubs\n     or switches are included in your network setup, they may be faulty, as\n     well.\nIf using a wireless connection, check whether the wireless link can be\n     established by other machines. If not, contact the wireless network's\n     administrator.\nWhen you have checked your basic network connectivity, try to find out\n     which service is not responding. Gather the address information of all\n     network servers needed in your setup. Either look them up in the\n     appropriate YaST module or ask your system administrator. The following\n     list gives some typical network servers involved in a setup together with\n     the symptoms of an outage.\nDNS (name service)\nA broken or malfunctioning name service affects the network's\n        functionality in many ways. If the local machine relies on any network\n        servers for authentication and these servers cannot be found because of\n        name resolution issues, users would not even be able to log in.\n        Machines in the network managed by a broken name server would not be\n        able to\n“\nsee\n”\neach other and communicate.\nNTP (time service)\nA malfunctioning or completely broken NTP service could affect Kerberos\n        authentication and X server functionality.\nNFS (file service)\nIf any application needs data stored in an NFS mounted directory, it\n        cannot start or function properly if this service was down or\n        misconfigured. In the worst case scenario, a user's personal desktop\n        configuration would not come up if their home directory containing the\n.gconf\nsubdirectory could not be found because of\n        a faulty NFS server.\nSamba (file service)\nIf any application needs data stored in a directory on a faulty Samba\n        server, it cannot start or function properly.\nNIS (user management)\nIf your\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nsystem relies on a faulty NIS server to provide\n        the user data, users cannot log in to this machine.\nLDAP (user management)\nIf your\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nsystem relies on a faulty LDAP server to provide\n        the user data, users cannot log in to this machine.\nKerberos (authentication)\nAuthentication will not work and login to any machine fails.\nCUPS (network printing)\nUsers cannot print.\nCheck whether the network servers are running and whether your network\n     setup allows you to establish a connection:\nImportant: Limitations\nThe debugging procedure described below only applies to a simple network\n      server/client setup that does not involve any internal routing. It\n      assumes both server and client are members of the same subnet without the\n      need for additional routing.\nUse\nping\nIP_ADDRESS/HOSTNAME\n(replace with the host name or IP address of the server) to check whether\n       each one of them is up and responding to the network. If this command is\n       successful, it tells you that the host you were looking for is up and\n       running and that the name service for your network is configured\n       correctly.\nIf ping fails with\ndestination host unreachable\n,\n       either your system or the desired server is not properly configured or\n       down. Check whether your system is reachable by running\nping\nIP address\nor\nYOUR_HOSTNAME\nfrom another machine. If you\n       can reach your machine from another machine, it is the server that is\n       not running or not configured correctly.\nIf ping fails with\nunknown host\n, the name service is\n       not configured correctly or the host name used was incorrect. For\n       further checks on this matter, refer to\nStep 4.b\n. If\n       ping still fails, either your network card is not configured correctly\n       or your network hardware is faulty.\nUse\nhost\nHOSTNAME\nto\n       check whether the host name of the server you are trying to connect to\n       is properly translated into an IP address and vice versa. If this\n       command returns the IP address of this host, the name service is up and\n       running. If the\nhost\ncommand fails, check all network\n       configuration files relating to name and address resolution on your\n       host:\n/var/run/netconfig/resolv.conf\nThis file is used to keep track of the name server and domain you are\n          currently using. It is a symbolic link to\n/run/netconfig/resolv.conf\nand is usually\n          automatically adjusted by YaST or DHCP.\n          Make sure that this file has the following structure and all\n          network addresses and domain names are correct:\nsearch\nFULLY_QUALIFIED_DOMAIN_NAME\nnameserver\nIPADDRESS_OF_NAMESERVER\nThis file can contain more than one name server address, but at least\n          one of them must be correct to provide name resolution to your host.\n          If needed, adjust this file using the YaST Network Settings module\n          (Hostname/DNS tab).\nIf your network connection is handled via DHCP, enable DHCP to change\n          host name and name service information by selecting\nSet\n          Hostname via DHCP\n(can be set globally for any interface or\n          per interface) and\nUpdate Name Servers and Search List via DHCP\nin the YaST Network Settings module (Hostname/DNS tab).\n/etc/nsswitch.conf\nThis file tells Linux where to look for name service information. It\n          should look like this:\n...\nhosts: files dns\nnetworks: files dns\n...\nThe\ndns\nentry is vital. It tells Linux to\n                    use an external name server. Normally, these entries are\n                    automatically managed by YaST, but it would be prudent to\n                    check.\nIf all the relevant entries on the host are correct, let\n                    your system administrator check the DNS server\n                    configuration for the correct zone information.\nFor detailed information about DNS,\n                    refer to\nChapter 39,\nThe domain name system\n.\nIf you have\n                    made sure that the DNS configuration of your host and the\n                    DNS server are correct, proceed with checking the\n                    configuration of your network and network device.\nIf your system cannot establish a connection to a network server\n              and you have excluded name service problems from the list of\n              possible culprits, check the configuration of your network card.\nUse the command\nip addr show\nNETWORK_DEVICE\nto check whether this\n              device was properly configured. Make sure that the\ninet\n              address\nwith the netmask\n              (\n/\nMASK\n) is\n              configured correctly. An error in the IP address or a missing bit\n              in your network mask would render your network configuration\n              unusable. If necessary, perform this check on the server as well.\nIf the name service and network hardware are properly configured\n              and running, but certain external network connections still get\n              long timeouts or fail entirely, use\ntraceroute\nFULLY_QUALIFIED_DOMAIN_NAME\n(executed\n              as\nroot\n) to track the network route these requests are\n              taking. This command lists any gateway (hop) that a request from\n              your machine passes on its way to its destination. It lists the\n              response time of each hop and whether this hop is reachable. Use\n              a combination of traceroute and ping to track down the culprit\n              and let the administrators know.\nWhen you have identified the cause of your network trouble, you can resolve\n   it yourself (if the problem is located on your machine) or let the system\n   administrators of your network know about your findings so they can\n   reconfigure the services or repair the necessary systems.\n48.4.1\nNetworkManager problems\n#\nIf you have a problem with network connectivity, narrow it down as\n        described in\nProcedure 48.2, “How to identify network problems”\n. If NetworkManager seems\n        to be the culprit, proceed as follows to get logs providing hints on\n        why NetworkManager fails:\nOpen a shell and log in as\nroot\n.\nRestart the NetworkManager:\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl restart NetworkManager\nOpen a Web page, for example,\nhttp://www.opensuse.org\nas normal user to see, if\n      you can connect.\nCollect any information about the state of NetworkManager in\n/var/log/NetworkManager\n.\nFor more information about NetworkManager, refer to\nChapter 31,\nUsing NetworkManager\n.\n48.5\nData problems\n#\nData problems are when the machine may or may not boot properly but, in\n   either case, it is clear that there is data corruption on the system and\n   that the system needs to be recovered. These situations call for a backup of\n   your critical data, enabling you to recover the system state from before\n   your system failed.\n48.5.1\nManaging partition images\n#\nSometimes you need to perform a backup from an entire partition or even\n    hard disk. Linux comes with the\ndd\ntool which can create\n    an exact copy of your disk. Combined with\ngzip\nyou save\n    some space.\nProcedure 48.3:\nBacking up and restoring hard disks\n#\nStart a Shell as user\nroot\n.\nSelect your source device. Typically this is something like\n/dev/sda\n(labeled as\nSOURCE\n).\nDecide where you want to store your image (labeled as\nBACKUP_PATH\n). It must be different from your\n      source device. In other words: if you make a backup from\n/dev/sda\n, your image file must not to be stored\n      under\n/dev/sda\n.\nRun the commands to create a compressed image file:\n#\ndd if=/dev/\nSOURCE\n| gzip > /\nBACKUP_PATH\n/image.gz\nRestore the hard disk with the following commands:\n#\ngzip -dc /\nBACKUP_PATH\n/image.gz | dd of=/dev/\nSOURCE\nIf you only need to back up a partition, replace the\nSOURCE\nplaceholder with your respective\n    partition. In this case, your image file can lie on the same hard disk, but\n    on a different partition.\n48.5.2\nUsing the rescue system\n#\nThere are several reasons a system could fail to come up and run properly. A\n  corrupted file system following a system crash, corrupted configuration\n  files, or a corrupted boot loader configuration are the most common ones.\nTo help you to resolve these situations,\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\ncontains a rescue\n  system that you can boot. The rescue system is a small Linux system that can\n  be loaded into a RAM disk and mounted as root file system, allowing you to\n  access your Linux partitions from the outside. Using the rescue system, you\n  can recover or modify any important aspect of your system.\nManipulate any type of configuration file.\nCheck the file system for defects and start automatic repair processes.\nAccess the installed system in a\n“\nchange root\n”\nenvironment.\nCheck, modify, and re-install the boot loader configuration.\nRecover from a badly installed device driver or unusable kernel.\nResize partitions using the parted command. Find more information about\n    this tool at the GNU Parted Web site\nhttp://www.gnu.org/software/parted/parted.html\n.\nThe rescue system can be loaded from various sources and locations. The\n  simplest option is to boot the rescue system from the original installation\n  medium.\nNote: IBM Z: starting the rescue system\nOn IBM Z the installation system can be used for rescue purposes. To\n   start the rescue system follow the instructions in\nSection 48.6, “IBM Z: using initrd as a rescue system”\n.\nInsert the installation medium into your DVD drive.\nReboot the system.\nAt the boot screen, press\nF4\nand choose\nDVD-ROM\n. Then choose\nRescue System\nfrom the main menu.\nEnter\nroot\nat the\nRescue:\nprompt. A\n    password is not required.\nIf your hardware setup does not include a DVD drive, you can boot the rescue\n   system from a network source. The following example applies to a remote boot\n   scenario—if using another boot medium, such as a DVD, modify the\ninfo\nfile accordingly and boot as you would for a\n   normal installation.\nEnter the configuration of your PXE boot setup and add the lines\ninstall=\nPROTOCOL\n://\nINSTSOURCE\nand\nrescue=1\n. If you need to start the repair system,\n    use\nrepair=1\ninstead. As with a normal installation,\nPROTOCOL\nstands for any of the supported network\n    protocols (NFS, HTTP, FTP, etc.) and\nINSTSOURCE\nfor the path to your network installation source.\nBoot the system using\n“\nWake on LAN\n”\n, as\n    described in\nSection 17.5, “Using wake-on-LAN for remote wakeups”\n.\nEnter\nroot\nat the\nRescue:\nprompt. A\n    password is not required.\nWhen you have entered the rescue system, you can use the virtual consoles\n  that can be reached with\nAlt\n–\nF1\nto\nAlt\n–\nF6\n.\nA shell and other useful utilities, such as the mount program, are\n  available in the\n/bin\ndirectory. The\n/sbin\ndirectory contains important file and network\n  utilities for reviewing and repairing the file system. This directory also\n  contains the most important binaries for system maintenance, such as\nfdisk\n,\nmkfs\n,\nmkswap\n,\nmount\n, and\nshutdown\n,\nip\nand\nss\nfor maintaining the network.\n  The directory\n/usr/bin\ncontains the vi editor, find,\n  less, and SSH.\nTo see the system messages, either use the command\ndmesg\nor view the system log with\njournalctl\n.\n48.5.2.1\nChecking and manipulating configuration files\n#\nAs an example for a configuration that might be fixed using the rescue\n   system, imagine you have a broken configuration file that prevents the\n   system from booting properly. You can fix this using the rescue system.\nTo manipulate a configuration file, proceed as follows:\nStart the rescue system using one of the methods described above.\nTo mount a root file system located under\n/dev/sda6\nto the rescue system, use the following command:\n>\nsudo\nmount /dev/sda6 /mnt\nAll directories of the system are now located under\n/mnt\nChange the directory to the mounted root file system:\n>\nsudo\ncd /mnt\nOpen the problematic configuration file in the vi editor. Adjust and save\n     the configuration.\nUnmount the root file system from the rescue system:\n>\nsudo\numount /mnt\nReboot the machine.\n48.5.2.2\nRepairing and checking file systems\n#\nGenerally, file systems cannot be repaired on a running system. If you\n    encounter serious problems, you may not even be able to mount your root\n    file system and the system boot may end with a\n“\nkernel panic\n”\n.\n    In this case, the only way is to repair the system from the outside. The\n    system contains the\nfsck\nutility to check and repair\n    multiple file system types, such as\next2\n,\next3\n,\next4\n,\nmsdos\n,\n    and\nvfat\n. Use the\n-t\noption to specify\n    which file system to check.\nThe following command checks all\next4\nfile systems found\n    in the\n/etc/fstab\nspecification:\n>\nsudo\nfsck -t ext4 -A\nTip\nFor Btrfs, you can use the\nbtrfs check\ncommand found in\n    the\nbtrfsprogs\npackage.\nFind topics about the Btrfs file system in the following\n    places:\nThe Storage Administration Guide includes\nhttps://documentation.suse.com/sles/html/SLES-all/cha-filesystems.html#sec-filesystems-major-btrfs\nand\nhttps://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP5/html/SLES-all/cha-resize-fs.html#sec-resize-fs-btrfs\nsections.\nThe following article\nhttps://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000018769\ndescribes how to recover from Btrfs errors.\nThe following article includes links to multiple Btrfs related topics\nhttps://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000018779\n.\nThe\nman 8 btrfs-check\nman page details all options\n        of the\nbtrfs check\ncommand.\n48.5.2.3\nAccessing the installed system\n#\nIf you need to access the installed system from the rescue system, you need\n   to do this in a\nchange root\nenvironment. For example,\n   to modify the boot loader configuration, or to execute a hardware\n   configuration utility.\nTo set up a change root environment based on the installed system, proceed\n   as follows:\nTip: Import LVM volume groups\nIf you are using an LVM setup (refer to\nPart II, “Logical volumes (LVM)”\nfor more\n      general details), import all existing volume groups to be able to\n      find and mount the device(s):\nroot\nvgimport -a\nRun\nlsblk\nto check which node corresponds to the root\n     partition. It is\n/dev/sda2\nin our example:\n>\nlsblk\nNAME        MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE  MOUNTPOINT\nsda           8:0    0 149,1G  0 disk\n├─sda1        8:1    0     2G  0 part  [SWAP]\n├─sda2        8:2    0    20G  0 part  /\n└─sda3        8:3    0   127G  0 part\n  └─cr_home 254:0    0   127G  0 crypt /home\nMount the root partition from the installed system:\n>\nsudo\nmount /dev/sda2 /mnt\nMount\n/proc\n,\n/dev\n, and\n/sys\npartitions:\n>\nsudo\nmount -t proc none /mnt/proc\n>\nsudo\nmount --rbind /dev /mnt/dev\n>\nsudo\nmount --rbind /sys /mnt/sys\nNow you can\n“\nchange root\n”\ninto the new environment, keeping\n     the\nbash\nshell:\n>\nchroot /mnt /bin/bash\nFinally, mount the remaining partitions from the installed system:\n>\nmount -a\nNow you have access to the installed system. Before rebooting the system,\n     unmount the partitions with\numount\n-a\nand leave the\n“\nchange root\n”\nenvironment with\nexit\n.\nWarning: Limitations\nAlthough you have full access to the files and applications of the\n    installed system, there are some limitations. The kernel that is running is\n    the one that was booted with the rescue system, not with the change root\n    environment. It only supports essential hardware and it is not possible to\n    add kernel modules from the installed system unless the kernel versions are\n    identical. Always check the version of the currently running (rescue)\n    kernel with\nuname -r\nand then find out if a matching\n    subdirectory exists in the\n/lib/modules\ndirectory in\n    the change root environment. If yes, you can use the installed modules,\n    otherwise you need to supply their correct versions on other media, such as\n    a flash disk. Most often the rescue kernel version differs from the\n    installed one — then you cannot simply access a sound card, for\n    example. It is also not possible to start a graphical user interface.\nAlso note that you leave the\n“\nchange root\n”\nenvironment when\n    you switch the console with\nAlt\n–\nF1\nto\nAlt\n–\nF6\n.\n48.5.2.4\nModifying and re-installing the boot loader\n#\nSometimes a system cannot boot because the boot loader configuration is\n   corrupted. The start-up routines cannot, for example, translate physical\n   drives to the actual locations in the Linux file system without a working\n   boot loader.\nTo check the boot loader configuration and re-install the boot loader,\n   proceed as follows:\nPerform the necessary steps to access the installed system as described in\nSection 48.5.2.3, “Accessing the installed system”\n.\nCheck that the GRUB 2 boot loader is installed on the system. If not,\n     install the package\ngrub2\nand run\n>\nsudo\ngrub2-install /dev/sda\nCheck whether the following files are correctly configured according to\n     the GRUB 2 configuration principles outlined in\nChapter 18,\nThe boot loader GRUB 2\nand apply fixes if necessary.\n/etc/default/grub\n/boot/grub2/device.map\n/boot/grub2/grub.cfg\n(this file is generated, do\n       not edit)\n/etc/sysconfig/bootloader\nRe-install the boot loader using the following command sequence:\n>\nsudo\ngrub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg\nUnmount the partitions, log out of the\n“\nchange root\n”\nenvironment, and reboot the system:\n>\numount -a\nexit\nreboot\n48.5.2.5\nFixing kernel installation\n#\nA kernel update may introduce a new bug which can impact the operation of\n   your system. For example a driver for a piece of hardware in your system may\n   be faulty, which prevents you from accessing and using it. In this case,\n   revert to the last working kernel (if available on the system) or install\n   the original kernel from the installation media.\nTip: How to keep last kernels after update\nTo prevent failures to boot after a faulty kernel update, use the kernel\n    multiversion feature and tell\nlibzypp\nwhich\n    kernels you want to keep after the update.\nFor example to always keep the last two kernels and the currently running\n    one, add\nmultiversion.kernels = latest,latest-1,running\nto the\n/etc/zypp/zypp.conf\nfile. See\nChapter 27,\nInstalling multiple kernel versions\nfor more information.\nA similar case is when you need to re-install or update a broken driver for\n   a device not supported by\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n. For example when a hardware vendor\n   uses a specific device, such as a hardware RAID controller, which needs a\n   binary driver to be recognized by the operating system. The vendor typically\n   releases a Driver Update Disk (DUD) with the fixed or updated version of the\n   required driver.\nIn both cases you need to access the installed system in the rescue mode and\n   fix the kernel related problem, otherwise the system may fail to boot\n   correctly:\nBoot from the\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\ninstallation media.\nIf you are recovering after a faulty kernel update, skip this step. If you\n     need to use a driver update disk (DUD), press\nF6\nto load\n     the driver update after the boot menu appears, and choose the path or URL\n     to the driver update and confirm with\nYes\n.\nChoose\nRescue System\nfrom the boot menu and press\nEnter\n. If you chose to use DUD, you will be asked to\n     specify where the driver update is stored.\nEnter\nroot\nat the\nRescue:\nprompt. A\n     password is not required.\nManually mount the target system and\n“\nchange root\n”\ninto the\n     new environment. For more information, see\nSection 48.5.2.3, “Accessing the installed system”\n.\nIf using DUD, install/re-install/update the faulty device driver package.\n     Always make sure the installed kernel version exactly matches the version\n     of the driver you are installing.\nIf fixing faulty kernel update installation, you can install the original\n     kernel from the installation media with the following procedure.\nIdentify your DVD device with\nhwinfo --cdrom\nand\n       mount it with\nmount /dev/sr0 /mnt\n.\nNavigate to the directory where your kernel files are stored on the DVD,\n       for example\ncd /mnt/suse/x86_64/\n.\nInstall required\nkernel-*\n,\nkernel-*-base\n, and\nkernel-*-extra\npackages of your flavor with the\nrpm -i\ncommand.\nUpdate configuration files and reinitialize the boot loader if needed. For\n     more information, see\nSection 48.5.2.4, “Modifying and re-installing the boot loader”\n.\nRemove any bootable media from the system drive and reboot.\n48.6\nIBM Z: using initrd as a rescue system\n#\nIf the kernel of the SUSE® Linux Enterprise Server for IBM Z is upgraded or modified, it\n  is possible to reboot the system accidentally in an inconsistent state, so\n  standard procedures of IPLing the installed system fail. In such a case, you\n  may use the installation system for rescue purposes.\nIPL the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for IBM Z installation system as described in\nSection 5.3, “Preparing for installation”\n. Choose\nStart\n  Installation\nand enter all required parameters. After the\n  installation system has loaded and you are asked which display type to use to\n  control the installation, select\nSSH\n. Now you can log in\n  to the system with SSH as\nroot\nwithout a password.\nIn this state, no disks are configured. You need to configure them before you\n  can proceed.\nProcedure 48.4:\nConfiguring DASDs\n#\nConfigure DASDs with the following command:\ndasd_configure 0.0.0150 1 0\n0.0.0150 is the channel to which the DASD is connected. The\n1\nmeans activate the disk (a\n0\nat\n    this place would deactivate the disk). The\n0\nstands for\n“\nno DIAG mode\n”\nfor the disk (a\n1\nhere would\n    enable DAIG access to the disk).\nNow the DASD is online (check with\ncat /proc/partitions\n)\n    and can used for subsequent commands.\nProcedure 48.5:\nConfiguring a zFCP disk\n#\nTo configure a zFCP disk, it is necessary to first configure the zFCP\n    adapter. Do this with the following command:\nzfcp_host_configure 0.0.4000 1\n0.0.4000\nis the channel to which the adapter is attached\n    and\n1\nstands for activate (a\n0\nhere\n    would deactivate the adapter).\nAfter the adapter is activated, a disk can be configured. Do this with the\n    following command:\nzfcp_disk_configure 0.0.4000 1234567887654321 8765432100000000  1\n0.0.4000\nis the previously-used channel ID,\n1234567887654321\nis the WWPN (World wide Port Number),\n    and\n8765432100000000\nis the LUN (logical unit number).\n    The\n1\nstands for activating the disk (a\n0\nhere would deactivate the disk).\nNow the zFCP disk is online (check with\ncat\n    /proc/partitions\n) and can used for subsequent commands.\nNow the rescue system is fully set up and you can start repairing the\n  installed system. See\nSection 48.5.2, “Using the rescue system”\nfor\n  instructions on how to repair the most common issues.\n48.7\nIBM Z: After a kernel update the system boots into the previous kernel\n#\nInstalling a new kernel version on an IBM Z system does not automatically\n update the \"stage 1\" zipl loader. This means that after a restart the system\n boots into the old kernel. And if secure boot is enabled, booting fails when\n the old kernel is signed with a signing key that has been retracted by, for example, a\n shim update at the same time.\nTo solve the problem, refresh zipl to make it aware of the new kernel version.\n To do this, run the following command after you install the new kernel:\ngrub2-emu --kexec\nIn the grub2 boot menu, choose the new kernel to reboot. Run the command above\n the second time for the changes to take effect. Finally, run the following\n command to reinstall the boot loader:\nupdate-bootloader --reinit\nOn this page\n48.1\nFinding and gathering information\n48.2\nBoot problems\n48.3\nLogin problems\n48.4\nNetwork problems\n48.5\nData problems\n48.6\nIBM Z: using initrd as a rescue system\n48.7\nIBM Z: After a kernel update the system boots into the previous kernel\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

Everyone is permitted to copy and\n  distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not\n  allowed.\n0. PREAMBLE\n#\nThe purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other\n  functional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure\n  everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without\n  modifying it, either commercially or non-commercially. Secondarily, this\n  License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their\n  work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by\n  others.\nThis License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of\n  the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the\n  GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free\n  software.\nWe have designed this License to use it for manuals for free software,\n  because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come\n  with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this\n  License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual\n  work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed\n  book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is\n  instruction or reference.\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n#\nThis License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that\n  contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed\n  under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide,\n  royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the\n  conditions stated herein. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or\n  work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You\n  accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way\n  requiring permission under copyright law.\nA \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document\n  or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or\n  translated into another language.\nA \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the\n  Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or\n  authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related\n  matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall\n  subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a\n  Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be\n  a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters,\n  or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position\n  regarding them.\nThe \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are\n  designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says\n  that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit\n  the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as\n  Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document\n  does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.\nThe \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as\n  Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the\n  Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5\n  words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\nA \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,\n  represented in a format whose specification is available to the general\n  public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with\n  generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint\n  programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is\n  suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a\n  variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an\n  otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has\n  been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is\n  not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any\n  substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called\n  \"Opaque\".\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII\n  without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a\n  publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or\n  PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats\n  include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can\n  be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which\n  the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the\n  machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors\n  for output purposes only.\nThe \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such\n  following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License\n  requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have\n  any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent\n  appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the\n  text.\nA section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title\n  either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that\n  translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section\n  name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\",\n  \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when\n  you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\"\n  according to this definition.\nThe Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states\n  that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are\n  considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards\n  disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers\n  may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.\n2. VERBATIM COPYING\n#\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially\n  or non-commercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and\n  the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced\n  in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of\n  this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the\n  reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you\n  may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large\n  enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may\n  publicly display copies.\n3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\n#\nIf you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed\n  covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license\n  notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that\n  carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the\n  front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also\n  clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front\n  cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally\n  prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.\n  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the\n  title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as\n  verbatim copying in other respects.\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you\n  should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual\n  cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more\n  than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along\n  with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a\n  computer-network location from which the general network-using public has\n  access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete\n  Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the\n  latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin\n  distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent\n  copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one\n  year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through\n  your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the\n  Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them\n  a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n4. MODIFICATIONS\n#\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the\n  conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified\n  Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the\n  role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the\n  Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do\n  these things in the Modified Version:\nUse in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from\n    that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if\n    there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may\n    use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that\n    version gives permission.\nList on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities\n    responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,\n    together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all\n    of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release\n    you from this requirement.\nState on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version,\n    as the publisher.\nPreserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\nAdd an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the\n    other copyright notices.\nInclude, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving\n    the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this\n    License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\nPreserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and\n    required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.\nInclude an unaltered copy of this License.\nPreserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it\n    an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the\n    Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section\n    Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year,\n    authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add\n    an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.\nPreserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public\n    access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network\n    locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on.\n    These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network\n    location for a work that was published at least four years before the\n    Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to\n    gives permission.\nFor any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the\n    Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and\n    tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given\n    therein.\nPreserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their\n    text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not\n    considered part of the section titles.\nDelete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be\n    included in the Modified Version.\nDo not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to\n    conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\nPreserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\nIf the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that\n  qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the\n  Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as\n  invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in\n  the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any\n  other section titles.\nYou may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing\n  but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example,\n  statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an\n  organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a\n  passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of\n  Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and\n  one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any\n  one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,\n  previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are\n  acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old\n  one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old\n  one.\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give\n  permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply\n  endorsement of any Modified Version.\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n#\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this\n  License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,\n  provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of\n  all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant\n  Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve\n  all their Warranty Disclaimers.\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple\n  identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are\n  multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make\n  the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in\n  parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if\n  known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section\n  titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the\n  combined work.\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the\n  various original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise\n  combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled\n  \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\".\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n#\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents\n  released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this\n  License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the\n  collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim\n  copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it\n  individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License\n  into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects\n  regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n#\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and\n  independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or\n  distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from\n  the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's\n  users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included\n  in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the\n  aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of\n  the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire\n  aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket\n  the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if\n  the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed\n  covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\n8. TRANSLATION\n#\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute\n  translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing\n  Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their\n  copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant\n  Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.\n  You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in\n  the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include\n  the original English version of this License and the original versions of\n  those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the\n  translation and the original version of this License or a notice or\n  disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\",\n  or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1)\n  will typically require changing the actual title.\n9. TERMINATION\n#\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as\n  expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify,\n  sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically\n  terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received\n  copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\n  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n#\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU\n  Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be\n  similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address\n  new problems or concerns. See\nhttps://www.gnu.org/copyleft/\n.\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the\n  Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \"or any\n  later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\n  conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has\n  been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the\n  Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose\n  any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.\nADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\n#\nCopyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME.\nPermission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document\nunder the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2\nor any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;\nwith no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.\nA copy of the license is included in the section entitled “GNU\nFree Documentation License”.\nIf you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,\n  replace the “with...Texts.” line with this:\nwith the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the\nFront-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\nIf you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination\n  of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.\nIf your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend\n  releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software\n  license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free\n  software.\nOn this page\nB.1\nGNU Free Documentation License\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

They assume you have successfully booted\n/IPLed\ninto the installation system. For more detailed\n   installation instructions and deployment strategies, refer to the\nDeployment Guide\n.\nFor platform specific\n   preparations required to boot or IPL into the installation system, refer to\n   the following parts of the aforementioned guide:\nChapter 2,\nInstallation on AMD64 and Intel 64\nChapter 3,\nInstallation on AArch64\nChapter 4,\nInstallation on IBM POWER\nChapter 5,\nInstallation on IBM Z and LinuxONE\n1.1\nThe Unified Installer\n#\nStarting with\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n15, the installation medium only consists of\n    the Unified Installer, a minimal system for installing, updating, and registering\n    all SUSE Linux Enterprise base products. During the installation you can add functionality\n    by selecting modules and extensions to be installed on top of the Unified Installer.\n1.2\nInstalling offline or without registration\n#\nThe default installation medium SLE-15-SP4-Online-\nARCH\n-GM-media1.iso is optimized for size and\n    does not contain any modules and extensions. Therefore, the installation\n    requires network access to register your product and retrieve repository\n    data for the modules and extensions.\nFor installation without registering the system, use the\nSLE-15-SP4-Full-\nARCH\n-GM-media1.iso\nimage from\nhttps://www.suse.com/download/sles/\n.\nTip: Copying the installation media image to a removable flash disk\nUse the following command to copy the contents of the installation image\n     to a removable flash disk.\n>\nsudo\ndd if=\nIMAGE\nof=\nFLASH_DISK\nbs=4M && sync\nIMAGE\nneeds to be replaced with the path to the\nSLE-15-SP4-Online-\nARCH\n-GM-media1.iso\nor\nSLE-15-SP4-Full-\nARCH\n-GM-media1.iso\nimage file.\nFLASH_DISK\nneeds to be replaced\n     with the flash device. To identify the device, insert it and run:\n#\ngrep -Ff <(hwinfo --disk --short) <(hwinfo --usb --short)\ndisk:\n  /dev/sdc             General USB Flash Disk\nMake sure the size of the device is sufficient for the desired image. You\n     can check the size of the device with:\n#\nfdisk -l /dev/sdc | grep -e \"^/dev\"\n     /dev/sdc1  *     2048 31490047 31488000  15G 83 Linux\nIn this example, the device has a capacity of 15 GB. The command to use for\n     the\nSLE-15-SP4-Full-\nARCH\n-GM-media1.iso\nwould be:\ndd if=SLE-15-SP4-Full-\nARCH\n-GM-media1.iso of=/dev/sdc bs=4M && sync\nThe device must not be mounted when running the\ndd\ncommand. Note that all data on the partition will be erased!\n2\nThe installation procedure\n#\nTo install\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n, boot\nor IPL\ninto the\n   installer from the Unified Installer medium and start the installation.\n2.1\nLanguage, keyboard, and product selection\n#\nThe\nLanguage\nand\nKeyboard Layout\nsettings are initialized with the language you chose on the boot\n    screen. If you did not change the default, it will be English\n    (US). Change the settings here, if necessary. Use the\nKeyboard\n    Test\ntext box to test the layout.\nWith the Unified Installer you can install all SUSE Linux Enterprise base products:\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n15 SP4\n(\ncovered here\n)\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop\n15 SP4\n(\nfor\n    installation instructions, refer to\nhttps://documentation.suse.com/sled/\n)\nSUSE Linux Enterprise High Performance Computing\n15 SP4\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Real Time\n15 SP4\n(for installation instructions, refer to\nhttps://documentation.suse.com/sle-rt/\n)\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP applications\n15 SP4\n(for installation instructions, refer to\nhttps://documentation.suse.com/sles-sap\n)\nSUSE Manager Server 4.3 (for installation instructions, refer to\nhttps://documentation.suse.com/suma/\n)\nSUSE Manager Proxy 4.3 (for installation instructions, refer to\nhttps://documentation.suse.com/suma/\n)\nSUSE Manager Retail Branch Server 4.3 (for installation instructions, refer\n    to\nhttps://documentation.suse.com/suma-retail\n)\nSelect a product for installation. You need to have a registration code\n    for the respective product. In this document it is assumed\n    you have chosen\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n. Proceed with\nNext\n.\nTip: Light and high-contrast themes\nIf you have difficulties reading the labels in the installer, you can\n     change the widget colors and theme.\nClick the\nbutton or press\nShift\n–\nF3\nto open a theme selection dialog. Select a theme from the list and\nClose\nthe dialog.\nShift\n–\nF4\nswitches to the color scheme for vision-impaired users. Press the buttons\n     again to switch back to the default scheme.\n2.2\nLicense agreement\n#\nRead the License Agreement. It is presented in the language you have\n    chosen on the boot screen. Translations are available via the\nLicense Language\ndrop-down box. You need to accept\n    the agreement by checking\nI Agree to the License Terms\nto install\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n. Proceed with\nNext\n.\n2.3\nNetwork settings\n#\nA system analysis is performed, where the installer probes for storage\n    devices, and tries to find other installed systems. If the network was\n    automatically configured via DHCP during the start of the installation,\n    you will be taken to the registration step.\nIf the network is not yet configured, the\nNetwork\n    Settings\ndialog opens. Choose a network interface from the list\n    and configure it with\nEdit\n. Alternatively,\nAdd\nan interface manually.  See\nSection 8.6, “Network settings”\nand\nSection 23.4, “Configuring a network connection with YaST”\nfor more information.  If you prefer to do\n    an installation without network access, skip this step without making any\n    changes and proceed with\nNext\n.\n2.4\nIBM Z: disk activation\n#\nSkip this step if you are not installing on IBM Z hardware.\nConfigure the attached hard disks. Select DASD, Fibre Channel Attached\n    SCSI Disks (zFCP), or iSCSI for the installation of\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n. The\n    DASD and zFCP configuration buttons are only available if the\n    corresponding devices are attached. Proceed with\nNext\nto set up the selected disk type. For more information, refer to\nSection 8.5, “IBM Z: disk activation”\n.\n2.5\nRegistration\n#\nTo get technical support and product updates, you need to register and\n    activate\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nwith the SUSE Customer Center or a local registration server.\n    Registering your product at this stage also grants you immediate access to\n    the update repository. This enables you to install the system with the\n    latest updates and patches available.\nWhen registering, repositories and dependencies for the modules and\n    extensions, which you install with the next step, are loaded from the\n    registration server.\nRegister system via scc.suse.com\nTo register with the SUSE Customer Center, enter the\nE-mail Address\nassociated with your SUSE Customer Center account and the\nRegistration\n        Code\nfor\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n. Proceed with\nNext\n.\nRegister system via local RMT server\nIf your organization provides a local registration server, you may\n       alternatively register there. Activate\nRegister System via\n        local RMT Server\nand either choose a URL from the drop-down\n       box or type in an address. Proceed with\nNext\n.\nSkip registration\nIf you are offline or want to skip registration, activate\nSkip\n        Registration\n. Accept the warning with\nOK\nand\n       proceed with\nNext\n.\nImportant: Skipping the registration\nYour system and extensions need to be registered in order to retrieve\n        updates and to be eligible for support. Skipping the registration is\n        only possible when installing from the\nSLE-15-SP4-Full-\nARCH\n-GM-media1.iso\nimage.\nIf you do not register during the installation, you can do so at any\n       time later from the running system. To do so, run\nYaST\n›\nProduct\n        Registration\nor the command line tool\nSUSEConnect\n.\nTip: Installing product patches at installation time\nAfter\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nhas been successfully registered, you\n     are asked whether to install the latest available online updates during\n     the installation. If choosing\nYes\n, the system will be\n     installed with the most current packages without having to apply the\n     updates after installation. Activating this option is recommended.\nNote: Firewall settings for receiving updates\nBy default, the firewall on\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nonly blocks incoming connections.\n  If your system is behind another firewall that blocks outgoing traffic,\n  make sure to allow connections to\nhttps://scc.suse.com/\nand\nhttps://updates.suse.com\non ports 80 and 443 in order\n  to receive updates.\n2.6\nExtension and module selection\n#\nAfter the system is successfully registered, the installer lists modules\n    and extensions that are available for\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n. Modules are\n    components which allow you to shape the product according to your\n    needs. They are free of charge. Extensions add functionality to your\n    product. They are offered as subscriptions and require a registration key\n    that is liable for costs.\nThe availability of certain modules or extensions depends on the product\n    you have chosen in the first step of this installation. For a description\n    of the modules and their life cycles, select a module to see the\n    accompanying text. More detailed information is available in the\nModules and Extensions Quick Start\n.\nThe selection of modules indirectly affects the scope of the\n    installation, because it defines which software sources (repositories)\n    are available for installation and in the running system.\nThe following modules and extensions are available for\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n:\nBasesystem Module\nThis module adds a basic system on top of the Unified Installer. It is required\n         by all other modules and extensions. The scope of an installation that\n         only contains the base system is comparable to the installation\n         pattern\nminimal system\nof previous\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nversions. This module is selected for installation by default and\n         should not be deselected.\nDependencies:\nNone\nCertifications Module\nContains the FIPS certification packages.\nDependencies:\nBasesystem\nContainers Module\nContains support and tools for containers.\nDependencies:\nBasesystem\nDesktop Applications Module\nAdds a graphical user interface and essential desktop applications\n         to the system.\nDependencies:\nBasesystem\nDevelopment Tools Module\nContains compilers (including\ngcc\n) and libraries\n         required for compiling and debugging applications. Replaces the former\n         Software Development Kit (SDK).\nDependencies:\nBasesystem, Desktop Applications\nLegacy Module\nHelps you with migrating applications from earlier versions of\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nand other systems to SLES\n15 SP4\n, by\n         providing packages which are discontinued on SUSE Linux Enterprise. Packages in this\n         module are selected based on the requirement for migration and the\n         level of complexity of configuration.\nThis module is recommended when migrating from a previous product\n         version.\nDependencies:\nBasesystem, Server Applications\nNVIDIA Compute Module\nContains the NVIDIA CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) drivers.\nThe software in this module is provided by NVIDIA under the\nCUDA End User\n          License Agreement\nand is not supported by SUSE.\nDependencies:\nBasesystem\nPublic Cloud Module\nContains all tools required to create images for deploying\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nin cloud environments such as the Amazon Web Services\n         (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Compute Platform, or OpenStack.\nDependencies:\nBasesystem, Server Applications\nPython 3 Module\nThis module contains the most recent version of the selected Python 3 packages.\nDependencies:\nBasesystem\nServer Applications Module\nAdds server functionality by providing network services such as DHCP\n         server, name server, or Web server.\nThis module is\n         selected for installation by default; deselecting it is not\n         recommended.\nDependencies:\nBasesystem\nSUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability\nAdds clustering support for mission critical setups to\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n.\n         This extension requires a separate license key.\nDependencies:\nBasesystem, Server Applications\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Live Patching\nAdds support for performing critical patching without having to shut\n         down the system. This extension requires a separate license key.\nDependencies:\nBasesystem, Server Applications\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Workstation Extension\nExtends the functionality of\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nwith packages from SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop,\n         like additional desktop applications (office suite, e-mail client,\n         graphical editor, etc.) and libraries. It allows to combine both\n         products to create a fully featured workstation. This extension\n         requires a separate license key.\nDependencies:\nBasesystem, Desktop Applications\nSUSE Package Hub\nProvides access to packages for\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nmaintained by the\n         openSUSE community. These packages are delivered without L3 support\n         and do not interfere with the supportability of\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n. For\n         more information refer to\nhttps://packagehub.suse.com/\n.\nDependencies:\nBasesystem\nTransactional Server Module\nAdds support for transactional updates. Updates are either applied to\n         the system all together in a single transaction, or not. This\n         happens without influencing the running system. If an update fails, or\n         if the successful update is deemed to be incompatible or otherwise\n         incorrect, it can be discarded to immediately return the system to its\n         previous functioning state.\nDependencies:\nBasesystem\nWeb and Scripting Module\nContains packages intended for a running Web server.\nDependencies:\nBasesystem, Server Applications\nSome modules depend on the installation of other\n      modules. Therefore, when selecting a module, other modules may be\n      selected automatically to fulfill dependencies.\nDepending on the product, the registration server can mark modules and\n      extensions as recommended. Recommended modules and extensions are\n      preselected for registration and installation. To avoid installing\n      these recommendations, deselect them manually.\nSelect the modules and extension you want to install and proceed\n      with\nNext\n. In case you have chosen one or more\n      extensions, you will be prompted to provide the respective registration\n      codes. Depending on your choice, it may also be necessary to accept\n      additional license agreements.\nImportant: Default modules for offline installation\nWhen performing an offline installation from the SLE-15-SP4-Full-\nARCH\n-GM-media1.iso, only the\nBasesystem Module\nis selected by default.\nTo install the complete default package set of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server,\n        additionally select the\nServer Applications Module\n.\n2.7\nAdd-on product\n#\nThe\nAdd-On Product\ndialog allows you to add additional\n    software sources (so-called\n“\nrepositories\n”\n) to\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n, that are not provided by the SUSE Customer Center. Such add-on products\n    may include third-party products and drivers or additional software for\n    your system.\nTip: Adding drivers during the installation\nYou can also add driver update repositories via the\nAdd-On\n     Product\ndialog. Driver updates for SUSE Linux Enterprise are provided at\nhttp://drivers.suse.com/\n. These drivers have been\n     created via the SUSE SolidDriver Program.\nIf you want to skip this step, proceed with\nNext\n.\n    Otherwise activate\nI would like to Install an Add-on\n    Product\n. Specify a media type, a local path, or a network\n    resource hosting the repository and follow the on-screen instructions.\nCheck\nDownload Repository Description Files\nto\n    download the files describing the repository now. If deactivated, they\n    will be downloaded after the installation has started. Proceed with\nNext\nand insert a medium if required. Depending on the\n    product's content it may be necessary to accept additional license\n    agreements. Proceed with\nNext\n. If you have chosen an\n    add-on product requiring a registration key, you will be asked to enter\n    it before proceeding to the next step.\n2.8\nSystem role\n#\nThe availability of system roles depends on your selection of modules and\n    extensions. System roles define, for example, the set of software patterns\n    that is going to be preselected for the installation. Refer to the\n    description on screen to make your choice. Select a role and proceed\n    with\nNext\n. If from the enabled modules only one role\n    or no role is suitable for the respective base product, the\nSystem Role\ndialog is omitted.\nTip: Release notes\nFrom this point on, the Release Notes can be viewed from any screen\n     during the installation process by selecting\nRelease\n     Notes\n.\n2.9\nSuggested partitioning\n#\nReview the partition setup proposed by the system. If necessary, change\n    it. You have the following options:\nGuided setup\nStarts a wizard which lets you refine the partitioning proposal.\n       Options available here depend on your system setup. In case it\n       contains more than a single hard disk, you may choose which disk(s) to\n       use and where to place the root partition. If the disk(s) already\n       contain partitions, decide whether to remove or resize them.\nIn subsequent steps you may also add LVM support and disk\n       encryption. You can change the file system for the root partition and\n       decide whether to have a separate home partition or not.\nExpert partitioner\nOpens the\nExpert Partitioner\ndescribed in\nSection 10.1, “Using the\nExpert Partitioner\n”\n. This gives you full\n       control over the partitioning setup and lets you create a custom\n       setup. This option is intended for experts.\nWarning: Disk space units\nNote that for partitioning purposes, disk space is measured in binary\n     units, rather than in decimal units. For example, if you enter sizes of\n1GB\n,\n1GiB\nor\n1G\n,\n     they all signify 1 GiB (Gibibyte), as opposed to 1 GB (Gigabyte).\nBinary\n1 GiB = 1 073 741 824 bytes.\nDecimal\n1 GB = 1 000 000 000 bytes.\nDifference\n1 GiB ≈ 1.07 GB.\nTo accept the proposed setup without any changes, choose\nNext\nto proceed.\n2.10\nClock and time zone\n#\nSelect the clock and time zone to use in your system. To manually adjust\n    the time or to configure an NTP server for time synchronization, choose\nOther Settings\n. See\nSection 8.12, “Clock and time zone”\nfor detailed information. Proceed\n    with\nNext\n.\n2.11\nLocal user\n#\nTo create a local user, type the first and last name in the\nUser’s Full Name\nfield, the login name in the\nUsername\nfield, and the password in the\nPassword\nfield.\nThe password should be at least eight characters long and should contain\n    both uppercase and lowercase letters and numbers. The maximum length for\n    passwords is 72 characters, and passwords are case-sensitive.\nFor security reasons it is also strongly recommended\nnot\nto enable the\nAutomatic\n    Login\n. You should also\nnot\nUse\n    this Password for the System Administrator\nbut rather provide a\n    separate\nroot\npassword in the next installation step.\nIf you install on a system where a previous Linux installation was\n    found, you may\nImport User Data from a Previous\n    Installation\n. Click\nChoose User\nfor a list\n    of available user accounts. Select one or more user.\nIn an environment where users are centrally managed (for example by NIS\n    or LDAP) you can skip the creation of local users. Select\nSkip User Creation\nin this case.\nProceed with\nNext\n.\n2.12\nAuthentication for the system administrator\n“\nroot\n”\n#\nType a password for the system administrator (called the\nroot\nuser)\n    or provide a public SSH key. If you want, you can use both.\nBecause the\nroot\nuser is equipped with extensive permissions,\n    the password should be chosen carefully.\n    You should never forget the\nroot\npassword! After you entered it\n    here, the password cannot be retrieved.\nTip: Passwords and keyboard layout\nIt is recommended to only use US ASCII characters. In case of a system\n     error or when you need to start your system in rescue mode, the keyboard\n     may not be localized.\nIf you want to access the system remotely via SSH using a public key,\n    import a key from a removable media or an existing partition. See\nSection 8.14, “Authentication for the system administrator\nroot\n”\nfor more information.\nProceed with\nNext\n.\n2.13\nInstallation settings\n#\nUse the\nInstallation Settings\nscreen to review\n    and—if necessary—change several proposed installation\n    settings. The current configuration is listed for each setting. To change\n    it, click the headline. Some settings, such as firewall or SSH can\n    directly be changed by clicking the respective links.\nImportant: Remote access\nChanges you can make here, can also be made later at any time from the\n     installed system. However, if you need remote access right after the\n     installation, you may need to open the SSH port in the\nSecurity\nsettings.\nSoftware\nThe scope of the installation is defined by the modules and extensions\n       you have chosen for this installation. However, depending on your\n       selection, not all packages available in a module are selected for\n       installation.\nClicking\nSoftware\nopens the\nSoftware\n       Selection and System Tasks\nscreen, where you can change the\n       software selection by selecting or deselecting patterns. Each pattern\n       contains several software packages needed for specific functions (for\n       example,\nKVM Host Server\n). For a more detailed\n       selection based on software packages to install, select\nDetails\nto switch to the YaST\nSoftware\n       Manager\n. See\nChapter 8,\nInstalling or removing software\nfor more\n       information.\nBooting\nThis section shows the boot loader configuration.

Click the selected entry to choose\n       a different option. For details, see\nCPU Mitigations\n.\nBy default, the\nFirewall\nis enabled on all configured\n       network interfaces. To completely disable\nfirewalld\n, click\ndisable\n(not recommended). Refer to\nChapter 23,\nMasquerading and firewalls\nfor configuration details.\nNote: Firewall settings for receiving updates\nBy default, the firewall on\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nonly blocks incoming connections.\n  If your system is behind another firewall that blocks outgoing traffic,\n  make sure to allow connections to\nhttps://scc.suse.com/\nand\nhttps://updates.suse.com\non ports 80 and 443 in order\n  to receive updates.\nThe\nSSH service\nis enabled by default, but its port\n       (22) is closed in the firewall. Click\nopen\nto open the\n       port or\ndisable\nto disable the service. Note that if\n       SSH is disabled, remote logins will not be possible. Refer to\nChapter 22,\nSecuring network operations with OpenSSH\nfor more information.\nThe default\nMajor Linux Security Module\nis\nAppAmpor\n. To disable it, selese\nNone\nas module in the\nSecurity\nsettings.\nSecurity Policies\nClick to\nenable\nthe\nDefense Information Systems Agency STIG\nsecurity policy. If installation settings are incompliant with the\n       policy, you will be prompted to modify them accordingly. Some settings\n       can be adjusted automatically, others require user input.\nEnabling a security profile enables a full SCAP remediation on first\n       boot. You can also perform a\nscan only\nor\ndo\n       nothing\nand manually remediate the system later with\n       OpenSCAP.

For details, see\nSection 23.4, “Configuring a network connection with YaST”\n.\nImportant: Support for NetworkManager\nSUSE only supports NetworkManager for desktop workloads with SLED or the Workstation extension.\n        All server certifications are done with\nwicked\nas the network\n        configuration tool, and using NetworkManager may invalidate them. NetworkManager is not supported by SUSE for\n        server workloads.\nKdump\nKdump saves the memory image (\n“\ncore dump\n”\n) to the file\n       system in case the kernel crashes. This enables you to find the cause\n       of the crash by debugging the dump file. Kdump is preconfigured and\n       enabled by default. See\nSection 20.7, “Basic Kdump configuration”\nfor\n       more information.\nDefault systemd target\nIn case you have installed the desktop applications module, the system\n       boots into the\ngraphical\ntarget, with network,\n       multiuser and display manager support.

Everyone is permitted to copy and\n  distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not\n  allowed.\n0. PREAMBLE\n#\nThe purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other\n  functional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure\n  everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without\n  modifying it, either commercially or non-commercially. Secondarily, this\n  License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their\n  work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by\n  others.\nThis License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of\n  the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the\n  GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free\n  software.\nWe have designed this License to use it for manuals for free software,\n  because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come\n  with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this\n  License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual\n  work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed\n  book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is\n  instruction or reference.\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n#\nThis License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that\n  contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed\n  under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide,\n  royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the\n  conditions stated herein. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or\n  work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You\n  accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way\n  requiring permission under copyright law.\nA \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document\n  or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or\n  translated into another language.\nA \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the\n  Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or\n  authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related\n  matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall\n  subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a\n  Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be\n  a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters,\n  or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position\n  regarding them.\nThe \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are\n  designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says\n  that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit\n  the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as\n  Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document\n  does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.\nThe \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as\n  Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the\n  Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5\n  words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\nA \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,\n  represented in a format whose specification is available to the general\n  public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with\n  generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint\n  programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is\n  suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a\n  variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an\n  otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has\n  been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is\n  not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any\n  substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called\n  \"Opaque\".\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII\n  without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a\n  publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or\n  PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats\n  include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can\n  be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which\n  the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the\n  machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors\n  for output purposes only.\nThe \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such\n  following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License\n  requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have\n  any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent\n  appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the\n  text.\nA section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title\n  either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that\n  translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section\n  name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\",\n  \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when\n  you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\"\n  according to this definition.\nThe Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states\n  that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are\n  considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards\n  disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers\n  may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.\n2. VERBATIM COPYING\n#\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially\n  or non-commercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and\n  the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced\n  in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of\n  this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the\n  reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you\n  may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large\n  enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may\n  publicly display copies.\n3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\n#\nIf you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed\n  covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license\n  notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that\n  carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the\n  front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also\n  clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front\n  cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally\n  prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.\n  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the\n  title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as\n  verbatim copying in other respects.\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you\n  should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual\n  cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more\n  than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along\n  with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a\n  computer-network location from which the general network-using public has\n  access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete\n  Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the\n  latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin\n  distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent\n  copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one\n  year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through\n  your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the\n  Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them\n  a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n4. MODIFICATIONS\n#\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the\n  conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified\n  Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the\n  role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the\n  Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do\n  these things in the Modified Version:\nUse in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from\n    that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if\n    there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may\n    use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that\n    version gives permission.\nList on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities\n    responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,\n    together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all\n    of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release\n    you from this requirement.\nState on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version,\n    as the publisher.\nPreserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\nAdd an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the\n    other copyright notices.\nInclude, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving\n    the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this\n    License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\nPreserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and\n    required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.\nInclude an unaltered copy of this License.\nPreserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it\n    an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the\n    Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section\n    Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year,\n    authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add\n    an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.\nPreserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public\n    access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network\n    locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on.\n    These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network\n    location for a work that was published at least four years before the\n    Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to\n    gives permission.\nFor any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the\n    Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and\n    tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given\n    therein.\nPreserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their\n    text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not\n    considered part of the section titles.\nDelete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be\n    included in the Modified Version.\nDo not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to\n    conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\nPreserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\nIf the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that\n  qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the\n  Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as\n  invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in\n  the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any\n  other section titles.\nYou may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing\n  but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example,\n  statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an\n  organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a\n  passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of\n  Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and\n  one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any\n  one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,\n  previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are\n  acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old\n  one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old\n  one.\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give\n  permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply\n  endorsement of any Modified Version.\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n#\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this\n  License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,\n  provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of\n  all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant\n  Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve\n  all their Warranty Disclaimers.\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple\n  identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are\n  multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make\n  the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in\n  parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if\n  known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section\n  titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the\n  combined work.\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the\n  various original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise\n  combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled\n  \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\".\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n#\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents\n  released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this\n  License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the\n  collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim\n  copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it\n  individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License\n  into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects\n  regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n#\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and\n  independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or\n  distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from\n  the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's\n  users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included\n  in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the\n  aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of\n  the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire\n  aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket\n  the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if\n  the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed\n  covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\n8. TRANSLATION\n#\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute\n  translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing\n  Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their\n  copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant\n  Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.\n  You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in\n  the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include\n  the original English version of this License and the original versions of\n  those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the\n  translation and the original version of this License or a notice or\n  disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\",\n  or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1)\n  will typically require changing the actual title.\n9. TERMINATION\n#\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as\n  expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify,\n  sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically\n  terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received\n  copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\n  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n#\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU\n  Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be\n  similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address\n  new problems or concerns. See\nhttps://www.gnu.org/copyleft/\n.\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the\n  Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \"or any\n  later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\n  conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has\n  been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the\n  Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose\n  any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.\nADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\n#\nCopyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME.\nPermission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document\nunder the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2\nor any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;\nwith no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.\nA copy of the license is included in the section entitled “GNU\nFree Documentation License”.\nIf you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,\n  replace the “with...Texts.” line with this:\nwith the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the\nFront-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\nIf you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination\n  of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.\nIf your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend\n  releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software\n  license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free\n  software.\nOn this page\n1\nWelcome to\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n2\nThe installation procedure\n3\nLegal notice\n4\nGNU Free Documentation License\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

Learn about their\n     purpose and features, and how to manage them.\nRevision History: SUSE Linux Enterprise Server Documentation\n1\nIntroduction to modules and extensions\n#\nStarting with\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n15, the installation medium consists of only the Unified Installer: a\n      minimal system for deploying, updating and registering\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n. During deployment, you\n      can add functionality by selecting modules and extensions to be installed on top of the\n      Unified Installer.\nTechnically, modules and extensions are very similar. Both can be managed with YaST or the\n      command-line tool\nSUSEConnect\n. Both modules and extensions add a set of\n      online repositories (\nmain\n,\nupdate\n,\nsource\n,\ndebug\n) containing all necessary packages.\n      Additionally, both may add partitioning proposals and system roles that can be chosen during\n      deployment.\nHowever, there are significant differences between modules and extensions:\nModules\nModules allow you to shape the product according to your needs. Each module has a\n            clearly defined scope ranging from tools for Web Development and Scripting, through a\n            Public Cloud, all the way to the SUSE Package Hub, offering community-managed\n            packages.\nModules enable you to provide only the set of packages required for the machine's\n            purpose, making the system lean, fast, and more secure. This modular approach also\n            makes it easy to provide tailor-made images for container and cloud environments.\nModules can be added or removed at any time during the lifecycle of the system. This\n            allows you to easily adjust the system to changing requirements.\nModules are part of your\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nsubscription and therefore free of charge. They\n            differ from the base of\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nonly by their lifecycle.\nExtensions\nExtensions provide advanced capabilities for tasks such as live patching and high\n            availability clustering to\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n. They are offered as subscriptions and require\n            a registration key that is liable for costs. Usually, extensions have their own release\n            notes that are available from\nhttps://www.suse.com/releasenotes\n.\n1.1\nSupport\n#\nL3 support is generally provided for packages except for\nSUSE Package\n        Hub\nand third-party modules. To check the support level for a package, run\nzypper info\nPACKAGE\n.\nLong-Term Service Pack Support\n(LTSS) is available for most modules and\n        extensions. For more information, refer to\nhttps://www.suse.com/products/long-term-service-pack-support/\n.\nSome modules and extensions also include\nExtended Service Pack Overlay\n        Support\n(ESPOS), which gives you significantly more time to upgrade and/or skip a\n        service pack completely.\nFor more information on support and lifecycles, refer to the\nSUSE Technical Support\n        Policy\nand the\nProduct Lifecycle Support\n        Policies\n. For a complete list of lifecycle dates by product, refer to the\nProduct Support Lifecycle\npage.\n2\nModules and extensions for the SUSE Linux Enterprise product family\n#\nThe following modules and extensions are available within the SUSE Linux Enterprise product family:\nBasesystem\nCertifications\nContainers\nDesktop Applications\nDevelopment Tools\nHigh Availability\nHigh Performance Computing\nLegacy\nLive Patching\nNVIDIA Compute\nPublic Cloud\nPython 3\nReal Time\nSAP Applications\nServer Applications\nSUSE Package Hub\nTransactional Server\nWeb and Scripting\nWorkstation Extension\nPlease note that the availability depends on the product. Not all modules and extensions are\n      available for all products. Some modules are included in one product but also available as\n      extension for another.\n2.1\nBasesystem\n#\nThis module adds a basic system on top of the Installer. It is required by all other\n        modules and extensions. The scope of an installation that only contains the base system is\n        comparable to the\nminimal\nsystem installation pattern of previous\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nversions. This module is selected for installation by default and should not\n        be deselected.\nDependencies:\nnone\nAvailability:\nDefault on all products\nLifecycle:\n10 years\nExtended Support:\n3 years LTSS\nSupport level:\nL3\n2.2\nCertifications\n#\nThis module contains the FIPS certification packages.\nDepends on\n: Basesystem\nAvailable for:\nSLES, SLED, SLES for SAP, SUSE Linux Enterprise Real Time,\n            SLE HPC\nLifecycle:\n10 years\nExtended support:\n3 years LTSS\nSupport level:\nL3\n2.3\nContainers\n#\nThis module contains packages relating to containers, including the container engine and\n        core container-related tools such as on-premise registry.\nImportant: Docker Swarm is not supported\nSUSE does not provide any support related to use of\nDocker\n            Swarm\norchestration. Related packages are shipped for customer convenience only.\nDependencies:\nBasesystem\nAvailability:\nSLES, SLES for SAP, SLE HPC\nLifecycle:\nBy package; follows the upstream community\n            of the respective package.\nExtended support:\n3 years LTSS\nSupport level:\nL3\n2.4\nDesktop Applications\n#\nThis module adds a graphical user interface  and\n        essential desktop applications to the system.\nDependencies:\nBasesystem\nAvailability:\nSLES, SLED (default), SLE WE\n            (default), SLES for SAP, SLE RT (default), SLE HPC\nLifecycle:\n10 years\nExtended support:\n3 years LTSS\nLevel:\nL3\n2.5\nDevelopment Tools\n#\nThis module contains compilers (including\ngcc\n) and libraries required\n        for compiling and debugging applications.

It is also\n        available as an extension for SLES and SLE HPC. For more information about SUSE Linux Enterprise\n        High Availability, refer to\nhttps://www.suse.com/products/highavailability\n.\nDependencies:\nBasesystem, Server Applications\nAvailability:\nSLES, SLES for SAP (included),\n            SLE HPC, SUSE Linux Enterprise Real Time\nLifecycle:\n10 years\nExtended support:\n3 years LTSS\nLevel:\nL3\n2.7\nHigh Performance Computing\n#\nThis extension contains tools and libraries related to High Performance Computing (HPC).\nDependencies:\nBasesystem\nAvailability:\nSLE HPC (included) on AMD64/Intel 64 and\n            AArch64\nLifecycle:\n10 years\nExtended support:\n1 year ESPOS, 3 years LTSS\nLevel:\nL3\n2.8\nLegacy\n#\nThis module helps you with migrating applications from earlier versions of\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nand other systems to SLES\n15 SP4\n, by providing packages which are discontinued\n        on SUSE Linux Enterprise. Packages in this module are selected based on the requirement for migration and\n        the level of complexity of configuration.\nThis module is recommended when migrating from a previous product version.\nPlease note that this module has a different lifecycle than some of its packages. Not all\n        packages are supported for the complete lifecycle of the module, but depend on migration\n        requirements and upstream lifecycles.\nDependencies:\nBasesystem, Server Applications\nAvailability:\nSLES, SLES for SAP\nLifecycle:\n10 years\nExtended support:\n3 years LTSS\nLevel:\nL3\n2.9\nLive Patching\n#\nThis extension provides packages to update critical components in SUSE Linux Enterprise without shutting\n        down your system, which reduces planned downtime and increases service availability.\nDependencies:\nBasesystem\nAvailability:\nSLES, SLES for SAP, SLE HPC on\n            AMD64/Intel 64, s390x, and ppc64le>\nLifecycle:\n10 years\nExtended support:\n3 years LTSS\nLevel:\nL3\n2.10\nNVIDIA Compute\n#\nThis module contains the NVIDIA CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) drivers. The\n        software in this module is provided by NVIDIA under the\nCUDA End User License\n        Agreement\nand is not supported by SUSE.\nTip: Importing third-party GPG keys\nAs this module is provided by a third party, the repository's GPG key is unknown to the\n          system. To activate the module and import the key with SUSEConnect, use the\n--gpg-auto-import-keys\noption:\nsuseconnect -p sle-module-NVIDIA-compute/15/x86_64 --gpg-auto-import-keys\nAlternatively, you can activate the module with\nyast registration\nor\n          during installation.\nImportant: Combining\nWorkstation Extension\nand\nNVIDIA Compute module\nis unsupported\nThe\nWorkstation Extension\nprovides drivers for NVIDIA graphics cards.\n          These drivers share some packages with CUDA, however, versions may differ. It is\n          therefore neither recommended nor supported to enable both the\nNVIDIA Compute\n          Module\nand the\nWorkstation Extension\nat the same time.\nDependencies:\nBasesystem\nAvailability:\nSLES and SLE HPC on AMD64/Intel 64 and\n            AArch64\nSupport:\nSoftware in this module is provided by NVIDIA\n            and is not supported by SUSE\n2.11\nPublic Cloud\n#\nThis module contains all tools required to create images for deploying\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nin\n        cloud environments. For example: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Compute\n        Platform, or OpenStack.\nDependencies:\nBasesystem, Server Applications\nAvailability:\nSLES, SLES for SAP, SLE HPC\nLifecycle:\n10 years\nExtended support:\n3 years LTSS\nLevel:\nL3\n2.12\nPython 3\n#\nThis module provides two additional Python interpreters:\nPython 3.10 and many additional maintained Python 3.10 modules. The Python 3.10\n            interpreter and modules are supported for 1.5 years until general support for SLE\n15 SP4\nends.\nPython 3.11 and many additional maintained Python 3.11 modules. The Python 3.11\n            interpreter and modules are supported until the end of December 2027 and might be\n            updated with the next service pack (if compatible and when needed).\nPackages from the Python 3 module can be installed alongside existing Python packages, and\n        they can coexist in the same system without impacting Python 3.6 workloads.\nDependencies:\nBasesystem\nAvailability:\nSLES, SLES for SAP, SLE HPC, SLED\nLifecycle:\nPython 3.10: 1.5 years (end of SLE\n15 SP4\ngeneral support), Python 3.11: 31 Dec 2027,\nExtended support:\nNone\nLevel:\nL3\n2.13\nReal Time\n#\nThis extension aims to reduce the latency and increase the predictability and reliability\n        of time-sensitive mission-critical applications.\nPackages in this module are generally supported until a newer version of the package is\n        released or the package is dropped from the module.\nDependencies:\nBasesystem, Desktop Applications,\n            Development Tools, Server Applications\nAvailability:\nSLE RT (included)\nLifecycle:\n10 years\nExtended support:\nNone\nLevel:\nL3\n2.14\nSAP Applications\n#\nThis module contains packages specific to SLES for SAP. It has a different lifecycle than\n        SUSE Linux Enterprise itself. Subscriptions for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP applications include 1.5 years of General Support plus 3\n        years of Extended Service Pack Overlap Support (ESPOS) for each service pack. This\n        eliminates the need for customers to purchase Long Term Service Pack Support (LTSS) until\n        the final service pack of a release.\nDependencies:\nBasesystem\nAvailability:\nSLES for SAP (included)\nLifecycle:\n10 years\nExtended support:\n3 years ESPOS, 3 years LTSS for last\n            SP\nLevel:\nL3\n2.15\nServer Applications\n#\nThis module adds server functionality by providing network services such as DHCP server,\n        name server or Web server.\nThis module is selected for installation by\n        default; deselecting it is not recommended.\nDependencies:\nBasesystem\nAvailability:\nSLES (default), SLES for SAP, SLE RT\n            (default), SLE HPC\nLifecycle:\n10 years\nExtended support:\n3 years LTSS\nLevel:\nL3\n2.16\nSUSE Package Hub\n#\nThis module provides access to packages for\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\nmaintained by the openSUSE\n        community. These packages are delivered without L3 support but do not interfere with the\n        supportability of\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n. For more information, refer to\nhttps://packagehub.suse.com/\n.\nDependencies:\nBasesystem\nAvailability:\nSLES, SLES for SAP, SLE RT, SLED,\n            SLE HPC\nLifecycle:\nNone\nExtended support:\nNone\nLevel:\nNone\n2.17\nTransactional Server\n#\nThis module provides SUSE Linux Enterprise systems with a method of updating the operating system and its\n        packages in an entirely\n“\natomic\n”\nway. Updates are either applied to the system\n        all together in a single transaction, or not at all. This happens without influencing the\n        running system. If an update fails, or if a successful update is deemed to be incompatible\n        or incorrect, you can discard it immediately and return to its previous functioning state.\nDependencies:\nBasesystem\nAvailability:\nSLES\nLifecycle:\n10 years\nExtended support:\n3 years LTSS\nLevel:\nL3\n2.18\nWeb and Scripting\n#\nThis module contains packages intended for a running Web server.\nDependencies:\nBasesystem, Server Applications\nAvailability:\nSLES, SLES for SAP, SLE HPC\nLifecycle:\n10 years\nExtended support:\n3 years LTSS\nLevel:\nL3\n2.19\nWorkstation Extension\n#\nThis extension offers additional desktop applications and libraries. It is installed by\n        default on SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop. Adding the Workstation Extension to a SUSE Linux Enterprise Server installation allows you to\n        seamlessly combine both products to create a fully featured server workstation. For more\n        information, refer to\nhttps://www.suse.com/products/workstation-extension\n.\nWarning: Unsupported kernel modules\nThe Workstation Extension installs the\nkernel-default-extra\npackage,\n          which includes additional kernel modules for desktop usage and enables loading of\n          unsupported modules. If actually loaded, these modules may compromise your SLE support\n          status.\nPlease evaluate if your hardware really requires additional kernel modules, and if so,\n          test this expanded driver set in addition to the default set from the\nkernel-default\npackage for possible configuration conflicts.\nTo prevent installation of the\nkernel-default-extra\npackage, run\nzypper addlock kernel-default-extra\n.\nDependencies:\nBasesystem, Desktop\nAvailability:\nSLES, SLED (default), SLES for SAP\nLifecycle:\n10 years\nExtended support:\nNone\nLevel:\nmixed L2/L3 (depending on package)\n3\nInstalling and managing modules and extensions\n#\nModules and extensions can be installed when initially setting up the system and on an\n      existing\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\ninstallation.\n3.1\nInstalling modules and extensions during system installation\n#\nModules and extensions can easily be installed when setting up the system. The respective\n        steps are part of the installation routine. Following the default installation path, this\n        requires network access to contact the SUSE Customer Center or a local registration server\n        (\nSUSE Manager\nor\n        Repository Mirroring Tool), which provide the respective repositories. Offline installation is supported,\n        too. In that case, an additional installation media is required. For detailed information,\n        refer to\nSection 8.8, “Extension and module selection”\n.\n3.2\nInstalling modules and extensions with YaST\n#\nTo install modules & extensions from the running system, you need to make sure your\n        system is registered with the SUSE Customer Center or a local registration server. If you have not done so\n        during the installation, refer to\nSection 9.3, “Registering from the installed system”\nfor\n        instructions.\nNote: Viewing already installed add-ons\nTo view already installed add-ons, start YaST and select\nSoftware\n›\nAdd-Ons\n.\nProcedure 1:\nInstalling add-ons and extensions from online channels with YaST\n#\nStart YaST and select\nSoftware\n›\nSystem\n            Extensions\n. YaST connects to the registration server and\n            displays a list of\nAvailable Extensions and Modules\n.\nNote: Available extensions and modules\nThe number of available extensions and modules depends on the registration server. A\n              local registration server may only offer update repositories and no additional\n              extensions.\nClick an entry to see its description.\nTo add modules or extensions, select all components you want to install. Note that all\n            extensions require additional registration codes which are liable for cost.\nClick\nNext\nto proceed.\nDepending on the repositories to be added for the extension or module, you may be\n            prompted to import the repository's GPG key or asked to agree to a license.\nThe YaST package manager opens to install\nrelease\n-packages for\n            each module and, depending on your choice of modules and extensions, additional\n            packages. It is strongly recommended\nnot to deselect\nany of the\n            preselected packages; you may, however, add additional packages.\nChoose\nAccept\nand\nFinish\nto conclude the process.\nIf needed, adjust the repository\nProperties\nas described in\nSection 8.4.2, “Managing repository properties”\n.\nTip: Module dependencies\nSimilar to software packages, which may depend on other packages to function, a module\n          may have dependencies on other modules. If this is the case, the modules on which it\n          depends are automatically selected for installation.\n3.3\nInstalling extensions and third-party add-on products from media\n#\nWhen installing an extension or add-on product from media, you can select various types of\n        product media, like DVD/CD, removable mass storage devices (such as flash disks), or a\n        local directory or ISO image. The media can also be provided by a network server, for\n        example, via HTTP, FTP, NFS, or Samba.\nStart YaST and select\nSoftware\n›\nAdd-On\n            Products\n. Alternatively, start the YaST\nAdd-On\n            Products\nmodule from the command line with\nsudo yast2\n            add-on\n.\nThe dialog will show an overview of already installed add-on products, modules and\n            extensions.\nClick\nAdd\nto install a new add-on product.\nIn the\nAdd-On Product\ndialog, select the option that matches the\n            type of medium from which you want to install:\nTo scan your network for installation servers announcing their services via SLP,\n                select\nScan Using SLP\nand click\nNext\n.\nTo add a repository from a removable medium, choose the relevant option and insert\n                the medium or connect the USB device to the machine, respectively. Click\nNext\nto start the installation.\nFor most media types, you will be prompted to specify the path (or URL) to the\n                media after selecting the respective option and clicking\nNext\n.\n                Specifying a\nRepository Name\nis optional. If none is specified,\n                YaST will use the product name or the URL as the repository name.\nThe option\nDownload Repository Description Files\nis activated by\n            default. If you deactivate the option, YaST will automatically download the files\n            later, if needed.\nDepending on the repository you have added, you may be prompted to import the\n            repository's GPG key or asked to agree to a license.\nAfter confirming these messages, YaST will download and parse the metadata. It will\n            add the repository to the list of\nConfigured Repositories\n.\nIf needed, adjust the repository\nProperties\nas described in\nSection 8.4.2, “Managing repository properties”\n.\nConfirm your changes with\nOK\nto close the configuration dialog.\nAfter having successfully added the repository for the add-on media, the software\n            manager starts, and you can install packages. For details, refer to\nChapter 8,\nInstalling or removing software\n.\n3.4\nDeleting modules and extensions with YaST\n#\nStart\nYaST\n›\nSoftware\n›\nAdd-On\n            Products\n.\nChoose the module or extension that should be removed and click\nDelete\n. Confirm the warning saying that all packages from the\n            selected component will be removed.\nThe YaST Software Manager opens and lists all installed packages from the deleted\n            module or extension. Click\nAccept\nto remove all of them. It is\n            strongly recommended to do so, because you will no longer get updates for packages from\n            deleted modules or extensions. If you keep packages, make sure to at least remove the\n*-release\npackage for each module or extension that gets deleted.\nProceed with\nAccept\nand then\nOK\n.\nWarning: Deleting modules\nNote that you should never delete the\nBasesystem Module\n. It is also\n          not recommended to delete the\nServer Applications\n          Module\n.\nWarning: No updates for packages from deleted modules and extensions\nIf you choose to keep packages from deleted modules or extensions, you will no longer\n          receive updates for these packages. Because this includes security fixes, keeping such\n          packages may introduce a security risk to your system.\n3.5\nAdding or deleting modules and extensions with SUSEConnect\n#\nRun\nSUSEConnect --list-extensions\nto get an overview of available\n            extensions:\n>\nsudo SUSEConnect --list-extensions\nAVAILABLE EXTENSIONS AND MODULES\n\n    Basesystem Module 15 SP4 x86_64 (Activated)\n    Deactivate with: SUSEConnect -d -p sle-module-basesystem/15.4/x86_64\n\n        Containers Module 15 SP4 x86_64\n        Activate with: SUSEConnect -p sle-module-containers/15.4/x86_64\n\n        Desktop Applications Module 15 SP4 x86_64\n        Activate with: SUSEConnect -p sle-module-desktop-applications/15.4/x86_64\n\n            Development Tools Module 15 SP4 x86_64\n            Activate with: SUSEConnect -p sle-module-development-tools/15.4/x86_64\n\n                NVIDIA Compute Module 15 x86_64\n                Activate with: SUSEConnect -p sle-module-NVIDIA-compute/15/x86_64\n\n            SUSE Linux Enterprise Workstation Extension 15 SP4 x86_64\n            Activate with: SUSEConnect -p sle-we/15.4/x86_64 -r\nADDITIONAL REGCODE\nPython 3 Module 15 SP4 x86_64\n        Activate with: SUSEConnect -p sle-module-python3/15.4/x86_64\n\n        SUSE Linux Enterprise Live Patching 15 SP4 x86_64\n        Activate with: SUSEConnect -p sle-module-live-patching/15.4/x86_64 -r\nADDITIONAL REGCODE\nSUSE Package Hub 15 SP4 x86_64\n        Activate with: SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/15.4/x86_64\n\n        Server Applications Module 15 SP4 x86_64 (Activated)\n        Deactivate with: SUSEConnect -d -p sle-module-server-applications/15.4/x86_64\n\n            Legacy Module 15 SP4 x86_64\n            Activate with: SUSEConnect -p sle-module-legacy/15.4/x86_64\n\n            Public Cloud Module 15 SP4 x86_64\n            Activate with: SUSEConnect -p sle-module-public-cloud/15.4/x86_64\n\n            SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension 15 SP4 x86_64\n            Activate with: SUSEConnect -p sle-ha/15.4/x86_64 -r\nADDITIONAL REGCODE\nWeb and Scripting Module 15 SP4 x86_64\n            Activate with: SUSEConnect -p sle-module-web-scripting/15.4/x86_64\n\n        Transactional Server Module 15 SP4 x86_64\n        Activate with: SUSEConnect -p sle-module-transactional-server/15.4/x86_64\n\n    Certifications Module 15 SP4 x86_64\n    Activate with: SUSEConnect -p sle-module-certifications/15.4/x86_64\n\n\nREMARKS\n\n(Not available) The module/extension is not enabled on your RMT/SMT\n(Activated)     The module/extension is activated on your system\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n\nYou can find more information about available modules here:\nhttps://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-15/singlehtml/art_modules/art_modules.html\nRun the commands in the listing for activating/deactivating a module or extension to\n            add or delete a component. Note that adding an extension requires additional\n            registration codes which are liable for cost.\nWarning: Deleting modules\nNote that you should never delete the\nBasesystem Module\n. It is also\n          not recommended to delete the\nServer Applications\n          Module\n.\nImportant: No automatic installation or removal of packages\nSUSEConnect\nonly adds or removes modules and extensions. It registers\n          or deregisters the components and enables or disables their repositories, but it does not\n          install or remove any packages. If you want this to be done automatically, use YaST to\n          manage modules and extensions.\nWhen adding a module or extension,\nSUSEConnect\ndoes not install\n          default packages or patterns. To do this manually, use Zypper or\nYaST\n›\nSoftware\n          Management\n.\nWhen deleting a module or extension,\nSUSEConnect\ndoes not perform a\n          cleanup. Packages from the module or extension remain installed on the system, but are no\n          longer updated from a repository. To list these\n“\norphaned\n”\npackages, run\nzypper packages --orphaned\n. To remove one or more packages, run\nzypper remove PACKAGE [ANOTHER_PACKAGE]\n. Alternatively, use\nYaST\n›\nSoftware Management\nand then\nView\n›\nPackage Classification\n›\nOrphaned Packages\nto list and delete orphaned packages.\nWarning: No updates for packages from deleted modules and extensions\nIf you choose to keep packages from deleted modules or extensions, you will no longer\n          receive updates for these packages. Because this includes security fixes, keeping such\n          packages may introduce a security risk to your system.\n4\nModule membership of packages\n#\nBy default, tools for searching software packages (YaST Software Management or\nzypper search\n) are restricted to searching within active repositories. For\n      an extended search including not yet activated remote repositories, you can run\nzypper search-packages\nPACKAGE\nTip: Searching for packages in the SUSE Customer Center\nYou can also search for packages and their respective modules in the SUSE Customer Center Web interface at\nhttps://scc.suse.com/packages\n. A SUSE login is\nnot\nrequired for this service.\nTo refine the search results,\nzypper search-packages\noffers the following\n      options:\n-x\n,\n--match-exact\nSearches for exact matches.\n-g\n,\n--group-by-module\nGroups the search results by modules rather than by package name.\n-d\n,\n--details\nAdditionally lists version numbers and repositories containing the package.\n--xmlout\nGenerates XML output.\nBelow are a few examples of how to use\nzypper search-packages\n.\nExample 1:\nSimple search\n#\nThe following command searches for the packages\nnodejs\nand\nhawk\n.

Everyone is permitted to copy and\n  distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not\n  allowed.\n0. PREAMBLE\n#\nThe purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other\n  functional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure\n  everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without\n  modifying it, either commercially or non-commercially. Secondarily, this\n  License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their\n  work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by\n  others.\nThis License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of\n  the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the\n  GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free\n  software.\nWe have designed this License to use it for manuals for free software,\n  because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come\n  with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this\n  License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual\n  work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed\n  book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is\n  instruction or reference.\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n#\nThis License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that\n  contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed\n  under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide,\n  royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the\n  conditions stated herein. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or\n  work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You\n  accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way\n  requiring permission under copyright law.\nA \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document\n  or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or\n  translated into another language.\nA \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the\n  Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or\n  authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related\n  matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall\n  subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a\n  Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be\n  a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters,\n  or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position\n  regarding them.\nThe \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are\n  designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says\n  that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit\n  the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as\n  Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document\n  does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.\nThe \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as\n  Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the\n  Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5\n  words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\nA \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,\n  represented in a format whose specification is available to the general\n  public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with\n  generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint\n  programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is\n  suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a\n  variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an\n  otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has\n  been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is\n  not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any\n  substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called\n  \"Opaque\".\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII\n  without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a\n  publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or\n  PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats\n  include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can\n  be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which\n  the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the\n  machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors\n  for output purposes only.\nThe \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such\n  following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License\n  requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have\n  any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent\n  appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the\n  text.\nA section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title\n  either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that\n  translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section\n  name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\",\n  \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when\n  you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\"\n  according to this definition.\nThe Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states\n  that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are\n  considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards\n  disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers\n  may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.\n2. VERBATIM COPYING\n#\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially\n  or non-commercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and\n  the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced\n  in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of\n  this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the\n  reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you\n  may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large\n  enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may\n  publicly display copies.\n3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\n#\nIf you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed\n  covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license\n  notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that\n  carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the\n  front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also\n  clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front\n  cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally\n  prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.\n  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the\n  title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as\n  verbatim copying in other respects.\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you\n  should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual\n  cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more\n  than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along\n  with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a\n  computer-network location from which the general network-using public has\n  access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete\n  Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the\n  latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin\n  distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent\n  copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one\n  year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through\n  your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the\n  Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them\n  a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n4. MODIFICATIONS\n#\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the\n  conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified\n  Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the\n  role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the\n  Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do\n  these things in the Modified Version:\nUse in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from\n    that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if\n    there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may\n    use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that\n    version gives permission.\nList on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities\n    responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,\n    together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all\n    of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release\n    you from this requirement.\nState on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version,\n    as the publisher.\nPreserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\nAdd an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the\n    other copyright notices.\nInclude, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving\n    the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this\n    License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\nPreserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and\n    required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.\nInclude an unaltered copy of this License.\nPreserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it\n    an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the\n    Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section\n    Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year,\n    authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add\n    an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.\nPreserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public\n    access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network\n    locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on.\n    These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network\n    location for a work that was published at least four years before the\n    Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to\n    gives permission.\nFor any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the\n    Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and\n    tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given\n    therein.\nPreserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their\n    text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not\n    considered part of the section titles.\nDelete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be\n    included in the Modified Version.\nDo not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to\n    conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\nPreserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\nIf the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that\n  qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the\n  Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as\n  invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in\n  the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any\n  other section titles.\nYou may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing\n  but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example,\n  statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an\n  organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a\n  passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of\n  Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and\n  one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any\n  one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,\n  previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are\n  acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old\n  one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old\n  one.\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give\n  permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply\n  endorsement of any Modified Version.\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n#\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this\n  License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,\n  provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of\n  all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant\n  Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve\n  all their Warranty Disclaimers.\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple\n  identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are\n  multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make\n  the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in\n  parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if\n  known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section\n  titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the\n  combined work.\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the\n  various original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise\n  combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled\n  \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\".\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n#\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents\n  released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this\n  License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the\n  collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim\n  copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it\n  individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License\n  into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects\n  regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n#\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and\n  independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or\n  distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from\n  the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's\n  users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included\n  in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the\n  aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of\n  the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire\n  aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket\n  the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if\n  the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed\n  covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\n8. TRANSLATION\n#\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute\n  translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing\n  Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their\n  copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant\n  Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.\n  You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in\n  the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include\n  the original English version of this License and the original versions of\n  those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the\n  translation and the original version of this License or a notice or\n  disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\",\n  or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1)\n  will typically require changing the actual title.\n9. TERMINATION\n#\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as\n  expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify,\n  sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically\n  terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received\n  copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\n  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n#\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU\n  Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be\n  similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address\n  new problems or concerns. See\nhttps://www.gnu.org/copyleft/\n.\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the\n  Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \"or any\n  later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\n  conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has\n  been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the\n  Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose\n  any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.\nADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\n#\nCopyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME.\nPermission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document\nunder the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2\nor any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;\nwith no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.\nA copy of the license is included in the section entitled “GNU\nFree Documentation License”.\nIf you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,\n  replace the “with...Texts.” line with this:\nwith the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the\nFront-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\nIf you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination\n  of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.\nIf your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend\n  releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software\n  license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free\n  software.\nOn this page\n1\nIntroduction to modules and extensions\n2\nModules and extensions for the SUSE Linux Enterprise product family\n3\nInstalling and managing modules and extensions\n4\nModule membership of packages\n5\nLegal notice\n6\nGNU Free Documentation License\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

It can\n      be used in multiple scenarios. To get more details about it, refer to the\nVirtualization Guide\nand in particular, to the following\n      sections:\nSection 2.1, “Server consolidation”\nSection 1.2, “Virtualization benefits”\nThis best practice guide will provide advice for making the right choice\n      in your environment. It will recommend or discourage the usage of options\n      depending on your workload. Fixing configuration issues and performing\n      tuning tasks will increase the performance of VM Guest's near to bare\n      metal.\n2\nBefore you apply modifications\n#\n2.1\nBack up first\n#\nChanging the configuration of the VM Guest or the VM Host Server can lead to\n        data loss or an unstable state. It is really important that you do\n        backups of files, data, images, etc. before making any changes. Without\n        backups you cannot restore the original state after a data loss or a\n        misconfiguration. Do not perform tests or experiments on production\n        systems.\n2.2\nTest your workloads\n#\nThe efficiency of a virtualization environment depends on many factors.\n       This guide helps to make good choices when configuring virtualization\n       in a production environment. Nothing is\ncarved in stone\n. Hardware, workloads, resource\n        capacity, etc. should all be considered when planning, testing, and\n        deploying your virtualization infrastructure. Testing your virtualized\n        workloads is vital to a successful virtualization implementation.\n3\nRecommendations\n#\n3.1\nPrefer the\nlibvirt\nframework\n#\nSUSE strongly recommends using the\nlibvirt\nframework to configure,\n        manage, and operate VM Host Servers and VM Guest. It offers a single\n        interface (GUI and shell) for all supported virtualization technologies\n        and therefore is easier to use than the hypervisor-specific tools.\nWe do not recommend using libvirt and hypervisor-specific tools at the\n        same time, because changes done with the hypervisor-specific tools may\n        not be recognized by the libvirt tool set. See\nChapter 8,\nlibvirt\ndaemons\nfor more information on libvirt.\n3.2\nqemu-system-i386 compared to qemu-system-x86_64\n#\nSimilar to real 64-bit PC hardware,\nqemu-system-x86_64\nsupports VM Guests running a\n        32-bit or a 64-bit operating system. Because\nqemu-system-x86_64\nusually also provides better\n        performance for 32-bit guests, SUSE generally recommends using\nqemu-system-x86_64\nfor both 32-bit and 64-bit\n        VM Guests on KVM. Scenarios where\nqemu-system-i386\nis known to perform better are not supported by SUSE.\nXen also uses binaries from the qemu package but prefers\nqemu-system-i386\n, which can be used for both 32-bit\n        and 64-bit Xen VM Guests. To maintain compatibility with the upstream\n        Xen Community, SUSE encourages using\nqemu-system-i386\nfor Xen VM Guests.\n4\nVM Host Server configuration and resource allocation\n#\nAllocation of resources for VM Guests is a crucial point when\n      administrating virtual machines. When assigning resources to VM Guests,\n      be aware that overcommitting resources may affect the performance of the\n      VM Host Server and the VM Guests. If all VM Guests request all their\n      resources simultaneously, the host needs to be able to provide all of\n      them. If not, the host's performance will be negatively affected and this\n      will in turn also have negative effects on the VM Guest's performance.\n4.1\nMemory\n#\nLinux manages memory in units called pages. On most systems the default\n        page size is 4 KB. Linux and the CPU need to know which pages belong to\n        which process. That information is stored in a page table. If a lot of\n        processes are running, it takes more time to find where the memory is\n        mapped, because of the time required to search the page table. To speed\n        up the search, the TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer) was invented. But\n        on a system with a lot of memory, the TLB is not enough. To avoid any\n        fallback to normal page table (resulting in a cache miss, which is time\n        consuming), huge pages can be used. Using huge pages will reduce TLB\n        overhead and TLB misses (pagewalk). A host with 32 GB\n        (32*1014*1024 = 33,554,432 KB) of memory and a 4 KB page size\n        has a TLB with\n33,554,432/4 = 8,388,608\nentries.\n        Using a 2 MB (2048 KB) page size, the TLB only has\n33554432/2048 = 16384\nentries, considerably\n        reducing the TLB misses.\n4.1.1\nConfiguring the VM Host Server and the VM Guest to use huge pages\n#\nThe AMD64/Intel 64 CPU architecture supports larger pages than 4 KB: huge\n          pages. To determine the size of huge pages available on your system\n          (could be 2 MB or 1 GB), check the\nflags\nline in the output of\n/proc/cpuinfo\nfor\n          occurrences of\npse\nand/or\npdpe1gb\n.\nTable 1:\nDetermine the available huge pages size\n#\nCPU flag\nHuge pages size available\nEmpty string\nNo huge pages available\npse\n2 MB\npdpe1gb\n1 GB\nUsing huge pages improves the performance of VM Guests and reduces\n          host memory consumption.\nBy default, the system uses THP. To make huge pages available on your\n          system, activate it at boot time with\nhugepages=1\n,\n          and—optionally—add the huge pages size with, for example,\nhugepagesz=2MB\n.\nNote: 1 GB huge pages\n1 GB pages can only be allocated at boot time and cannot be\n            freed afterward.\nTo allocate and use the huge page table (HugeTlbPage), you need to\n          mount\nhugetlbfs\nwith correct permissions.\nNote: Restrictions of huge pages\nEven if huge pages provide the best performance, they do come with\n            some drawbacks. You lose features such as Memory ballooning (see\nSection 6.1.3, “virtio balloon”\n), KSM (see\nSection 4.1.4, “KSM and page sharing”\n), and huge pages cannot be\n            swapped.\nProcedure 2:\nConfiguring the use of huge pages\n#\nMount\nhugetlbfs\nto\n/dev/hugepages\n:\n>\nsudo\nmount -t hugetlbfs hugetlbfs /dev/hugepages\nTo reserve memory for huge pages, use the\nsysctl\ncommand. If your system has a huge page\n              size of 2 MB (2048 KB), and you want to reserve\n              1 GB (1,048,576 KB) for your VM Guest, you need\n1,048,576/2048=512\npages in the pool:\n>\nsudo\nsysctl vm.nr_hugepages=\n512\nThe value is written to\n/proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages\nand represents the\n              current number of\npersistent\nhuge pages in\n              the kernel's huge page pool.\nPersistent\nhuge\n              pages will be returned to the huge page pool when freed by a\n              task.\nAdd the\nmemoryBacking\nelement in the VM Guest\n              configuration file (by running\nvirsh edit\nCONFIGURATION\n).\n<memoryBacking>\n  <hugepages/>\n</memoryBacking>\nStart your VM Guest and check on the host whether it uses\n              hugepages:\n>\ncat /proc/meminfo | grep HugePages_\nHugePages_Total:\n1\n512\nHugePages_Free:\n2\n92\nHugePages_Rsvd:\n3\n0\nHugePages_Surp:\n4\n0\n1\nSize of the pool of huge pages\n2\nNumber of huge pages in the pool that are not yet allocated\n3\nNumber of huge pages for which a commitment to allocate from\n                  the pool has been made, but no allocation has yet been made\n4\nNumber of huge pages in the pool above the value in\n/proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages\n. The maximum\n                  number of surplus huge pages is controlled by\n/proc/sys/vm/nr_overcommit_hugepages\n4.1.2\nTransparent huge pages\n#\nTransparent huge pages (THP) provide a way to dynamically allocate\n          huge pages with the\nkhugepaged\nkernel thread,\n          rather than manually managing their allocation and use. Workloads\n          with contiguous memory access patterns can benefit greatly from THP.\n          A 1000 fold decrease in page faults can be observed when running\n          synthetic workloads with contiguous memory access patterns.\n          Conversely, workloads with sparse memory access patterns (like\n          databases) may perform poorly with THP. In such cases it may be\n          preferable to disable THP by adding the kernel parameter\ntransparent_hugepage=never\n, rebuild your grub2\n          configuration, and reboot. Verify if THP is disabled with:\n>\ncat /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled\nalways madvise [never]\nIf disabled, the value\nnever\nis shown in square\n          brackets like in the example above.\nNote: Xen\nTHP is not available under Xen.\n4.1.3\nXen-specific memory notes\n#\n4.1.3.1\nManaging domain-0 memory\n#\nIn previous versions of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, the default memory allocation scheme\n            of a Xen host was to allocate all host physical memory to Dom0\n            and enable auto-ballooning. Memory was automatically ballooned from\n            Dom0 when additional domains were started. This behavior has\n            always been error prone and disabling it was strongly encouraged.\n            Starting in SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP1, auto-ballooning has been disabled by\n            default and Dom0 is given 10% of host physical memory +\n            1 GB. For example, on a host with 32 GB of physical\n            memory, 4.2 GB of memory is allocated to Dom0.\nThe use of\ndom0_mem\nXen command-line option in\n/etc/default/grub\nis still supported and\n            encouraged (see\nSection 7.5, “Change kernel parameters at boot time”\nfor\n            more information). You can restore the old behavior by setting\ndom0_mem\nto the host physical memory size and\n            enabling the\nautoballoon\nsetting in\n/etc/xen/xl.conf\n.\n4.1.4\nKSM and page sharing\n#\nKernel Samepage Merging is a kernel feature that reduces memory\n          consumption on the VM Host Server by sharing blocks of memory that\n          VM Guests have in common. The KSM daemon\nksmd\nperiodically scans\n          user memory, looking for pages with identical contents, which can be\n          replaced by a single write-protected page. To enable the KSM service,\n          first make sure that the package\nqemu-ksm\nis\n          installed, then run the command:\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl enable --now ksm.service\nAlternatively, it can also be started by running the command:\n#\necho 1 > /sys/kernel/mm/ksm/run\nOne advantage of using KSM from a VM Guest's perspective is that all\n          guest memory is backed by host anonymous memory. You can share\npagecache\n,\ntmpfs\nor any\n          kind of memory allocated in the guest.\nKSM is controlled by\nsysfs\n. You can check\n          KSM's values in\n/sys/kernel/mm/ksm/\n:\npages_shared\n: the number of shared pages that\n              are being used (read-only).\npages_sharing\n: the number of sites sharing the\n              pages (read-only).\npages_unshared\n: the number of pages that are\n              unique and repeatedly checked for merging (read-only).\npages_volatile\n: the number of pages that are\n              changing too fast to be considered for merging (read-only).\nfull_scans\n: the number of times all mergeable\n              areas have been scanned (read-only).\nsleep_millisecs\n: the number of milliseconds\nksmd\nshould sleep before\n              the next scan. A low value will overuse the CPU, consuming CPU\n              time that could be used for other tasks. We recommend a value\n              greater than\n1000\n.\npages_to_scan\n: the number of present pages to\n              scan before ksmd goes to sleep. A high value will overuse the\n              CPU. We recommend starting with a value of\n1000\nand then adjusting as necessary based on\n              the KSM results observed while testing your deployment.\nmerge_across_nodes\n: by default, the system\n              merges pages across NUMA nodes. Set this option to\n0\nto disable this behavior.\nNote: Use cases\nKSM is a good technique to over-commit host memory when running\n            multiple instances of the same application or VM Guest. When\n            applications and VM Guest are heterogeneous and do not share any\n            common data, it is preferable to disable KSM. To do that, run:\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl disable --now ksm.service\nAlternatively, it can also be disabled by running the command:\n#\necho 0 > /sys/kernel/mm/ksm/run\nIn a mixed heterogeneous and homogeneous environment, KSM can be\n            enabled on the host but disabled on a per VM Guest basis. Use\nvirsh edit\nto disable page sharing of a\n            VM Guest by adding the following to the guest's XML configuration:\n<memoryBacking>\n   <nosharepages/>\n</memoryBacking>\nWarning: Avoid out-of-memory conditions\nKSM can free up some memory on the host system, but the\n            administrator should reserve enough swap to avoid out-of-memory\n            conditions if that shareable memory decreases. If the amount of\n            shareable memory decreases, the use of physical memory is\n            increased.\nWarning: Memory access latencies\nBy default, KSM will merge common pages across NUMA nodes. If the\n            merged, common page is now located on a distant NUMA node (relative\n            to the node running the VM Guest vCPUs), this may degrade\n            VM Guest performance. If increased memory access latencies are\n            noticed in the VM Guest, disable cross-node merging with the\nmerge_across_nodes\nsysfs control:\n#\necho 0 > /sys/kernel/mm/ksm/merge_across_nodes\n4.1.5\nVM Guest: memory hotplug\n#\nTo optimize the usage of your host memory, it may be useful to\n          hotplug more memory for a running VM Guest when required. To support\n          memory hotplugging, you must first configure the\n<maxMemory>\ntag in the VM Guest's\n          configuration file:\n<maxMemory\n1\nslots='16'\n2\nunit='KiB'>20971520\n3\n</maxMemory>\n  <memory\n4\nunit='KiB'>1048576</memory>\n<currentMemory\n5\nunit='KiB'>1048576</currentMemory>\n1\nRuntime maximum memory allocation of the guest.\n2\nNumber of slots available for adding memory to the guest\n3\nValid units are:\n\"KB\" for kilobytes (1,000 bytes)\n\"k\" or \"KiB\" for kibibytes (1,024 bytes)\n\"MB\" for megabytes (1,000,000 bytes)\n\"M\" or \"MiB\" for mebibytes (1,048,576 bytes)\n\"GB\" for gigabytes (1,000,000,000 bytes)\n\"G\" or \"GiB\" for gibibytes (1,073,741,824 bytes)\n\"TB\" for terabytes (1,000,000,000,000 bytes)\n\"T\" or \"TiB\" for tebibytes (1,099,511,627,776 bytes)\n4\nMaximum allocation of memory for the guest at boot time\n5\nActual allocation of memory for the guest\nTo hotplug memory devices into the slots, create a file\nmem-dev.xml\nlike the following:\n<memory model='dimm'>\n  <target>\n  <size unit='KiB'>524287</size>\n  <node>0</node>\n  </target>\n</memory>\nAnd attach it with the following command:\n>\nvirsh attach-device vm-name mem-dev.xml\nFor memory device hotplug, the guest must have at least 1 NUMA cell\n          defined (see\nSection 4.6.3.1, “VM Guest virtual NUMA topology”\n).\n4.2\nSwap\n#\nSwap\nis usually used by the system to store\n        underused physical memory (low usage, or not accessed for a long time).\n        To prevent the system running out of memory, setting up a minimum swap\n        is highly recommended.\n4.2.1\nswappiness\n#\nThe\nswappiness\nsetting controls your system's swap\n          behavior. It defines how memory pages are swapped to disk. A high\n          value of\nswappiness\nresults in a system that\n          swaps more often. Available values range from\n0\nto\n200\n. A value of\n200\ntells the\n          system to find inactive pages and put them in swap. A value of\n0\ndisables swapping.\nTo do some testing on a live system, change the value of\n/proc/sys/vm/swappiness\non the fly and check the\n          memory usage afterward:\n#\necho 35 > /proc/sys/vm/swappiness\n>\nfree -h\ntotal       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:      24616680    4991492   19625188     167056     144340    2152408\n-/+ buffers/cache:    2694744   21921936\nSwap:      6171644          0    6171644\nTo permanently set a swappiness value, add a line in\n/etc/systcl.conf\n, for example:\nvm.swappiness = 35\nYou can also control the swap by using the\nswap_hard_limit\nelement in the XML configuration\n          of your VM Guest. Before setting this parameter and using it in a\n          production environment, do some testing because the host can\n          terminate the domain if the value is too low.\n<memtune>\n1\n<hard_limit unit='G'>1</hard_limit>\n2\n<soft_limit unit='M'>128</soft_limit>\n3\n<swap_hard_limit unit='G'>2</swap_hard_limit>\n4\n</memtune>\n1\nThis element provides memory tunable parameters for the domain.\n              If this is omitted, it defaults to the defaults provided b the\n              operating system.\n2\nMaximum memory the guest can use. To avoid any problems on the\n              VM Guest it is strongly recommended not to use this parameter.\n3\nThe memory limit to enforce during memory contention.\n4\nThe maximum memory plus swap the VM Guest can use.\n4.3\nI/O\n#\n4.3.1\nI/O scheduler\n#\nThe I/O scheduler for SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP2 and up is Budget Fair Queueing\n          (BFQ). The main aim of the BFQ scheduler is to provide a fair\n          allocation of the disk I/O bandwidth for all processes that request\n          an I/O operation. You can have different I/O schedulers for different\n          devices.\nTo get better performance in host and VM Guest, use\nnone\nin the VM Guest (disable the I/O scheduler)\n          and the\nmq-deadline\nscheduler for a virtualization\n          host.\nProcedure 3:\nChecking and changing the I/O scheduler at runtime\n#\nTo check your current I/O scheduler for your disk (replace\nsdX\nby the disk you want to check),\n              run:\n>\ncat /sys/block/\nsdX\n/queue/scheduler\nmq-deadline kyber [bfq] none\nThe value in square brackets is the one currently selected\n              (\nbfq\nin the example above).\nYou can change the scheduler at runtime by running the following\n              command as\nroot\n:\n#\necho mq-deadline > /sys/block/\nsdX\n/queue/scheduler\nIf you need to specify different I/O schedulers for each disk, create\n          the file\n/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/IO_ioscheduler.conf\nwith content similar to the following example. It defines the\nmq-deadline\nscheduler for\n/dev/sda\nand the\nnone\nscheduler for\n/dev/sdb\n. Keep in mind that the\n          device name can be different depending on the device type. This\n          feature is available on SLE 12 and up.\nw /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler - - - - mq-deadline\nw /sys/block/sdb/queue/scheduler - - - - none\n4.3.2\nAsynchronous I/O\n#\nMany of the virtual disk back-ends use Linux Asynchronous I/O (aio)\n          in their implementation. By default, the maximum number of aio\n          contexts is set to 65536, which can be exceeded when running hundreds\n          of VM Guests using virtual disks serviced by Linux Asynchronous I/O.\n          When running large numbers of VM Guests on a VM Host Server, consider\n          increasing /proc/sys/fs/aio-max-nr.\nProcedure 4:\nChecking and changing aio-max-nr at runtime\n#\nTo check your current aio-max-nr setting run:\n>\ncat /proc/sys/fs/aio-max-nr\n65536\nYou can change aio-max-nr at runtime with the following command:\n#\necho 131072 > /proc/sys/fs/aio-max-nr\nTo permanently set\naio-max-nr\n, add an entry to a\n          custom sysctl file.

These components can\n        either be:\nCPU processor\n: this describes the main CPU\n            unit, which usually has multiple cores and may support\n            Hyper-Threading.\nCPU core\n: a main CPU unit can provide more\n            than one core, and the proximity of cores speeds up the computation\n            process and reduces energy costs.\nCPU Hyper-Threading\n: this implementation is\n            used to improve parallelization of computations, but this is not as\n            efficient as a dedicated core.\n4.5.1\nAssigning CPUs\n#\nCPU overcommit occurs when the cumulative number of virtual CPUs of\n          all VM Guests becomes higher than the number of host CPUs. Best\n          performance is likely to be achieved when there is no overcommit and\n          each virtual CPU matches one hardware processor or core on the\n          VM Host Server. In fact, VM Guests running on an overcommitted host will\n          experience increased latency and a negative effect on per-VM Guest\n          throughput is also likely to be observed. Therefore, you should try\n          to avoid overcommitting CPUs.\nDeciding whether to allow CPU overcommit or not requires good\n          a-priori knowledge of workload as a whole. For example, if you know\n          that all the VM Guests virtual CPUs will not be loaded more than 50%\n          then you can assume that overcommitting the host by a factor of 2\n          (which means having 128 virtual CPUs in total, on a host with 64\n          CPUs) will work well. On the other hand, if you know that all the\n          virtual CPUs of the VM Guests will try to run at 100% for most of\n          the time then even having one virtual CPU more than the host has CPUs\n          is already a misconfiguration.\nOvercommitting to a point where the cumulative number of virtual CPUs\n          is higher than 8 times the number of physical cores of the VM Host Server\n          will most likely lead to a malfunctioning and unstable system and\n          should hence be avoided.\nUnless you know exactly how many virtual CPUs are required for a\n          VM Guest, start with one.\n          Target a CPU workload of approximately 70% inside your VM (see\nSection 2.3, “Processes”\nfor information on monitoring\n          tools). If you allocate more processors than needed in the VM Guest,\n          this will negatively affect the performance of host and guest. Cycle\n          efficiency will be degraded, as the unused vCPU will still cause\n          timer interrupts. In case you primarily run single threaded\n          applications on a VM Guest, a single virtual CPU is the best choice.\nA single VM Guest with more virtual CPUs than the VM Host Server has CPUs\n          is always a misconfiguration.\n4.5.2\nVM Guest CPU configuration\n#\nThis section describes how to choose and configure a CPU type for a\n          VM Guest. You will also learn how to pin virtual CPUs to physical\n          CPUs on the host system. For more information about virtual CPU\n          configuration and tuning parameters refer to the libvirt\n          documentation at\nhttps://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsCPU\n.\n4.5.2.1\nVirtual CPU models and features\n#\nThe CPU model and topology can be specified individually for each\n            VM Guest. Configuration options range from selecting specific CPU\n            models to excluding certain CPU features. Predefined CPU models are\n            listed in files in the directory\n/usr/share/libvirt/cpu_map/\n. A CPU model and\n            topology that is similar to the host generally provides the best\n            performance. The host system CPU model and topology can be\n            displayed by running\nvirsh capabilities\n.\nNote that changing the default virtual CPU configuration will\n            require a VM Guest shutdown when migrating it to a host with\n            different hardware. More information on VM Guest migration is\n            available at\nSection 11.7, “Migrating VM Guests”\n.\nTo specify a particular CPU model for a VM Guest, add a respective\n            entry to the VM Guest configuration file. The following example\n            configures a Broadwell CPU with the invariant TSC feature:\n<cpu mode='custom' match='exact'>\n  <model>Broadwell</model>\n  <feature name='invtsc'/>\n  </cpu>\nFor a virtual CPU that most closely resembles the host physical\n            CPU,\n<cpu mode='host-passthrough'>\ncan be\n            used. Note that a\nhost-passthrough\nCPU model may\n            not exactly resemble the host physical CPU, since by default KVM\n            will mask any non-migratable features. For example invtsc is not\n            included in the virtual CPU feature set. Changing the default KVM\n            behavior is not directly supported through libvirt, although it\n            does allow arbitrary pass-through of KVM command line arguments.\n            Continuing with the\ninvtsc\nexample, you can\n            achieve pass-through of the host CPU (including\ninvtsc\n) with the following command line\n            pass-through in the VM Guest configuration file:\n<domain type='kvm' xmlns:qemu='http://libvirt.org/schemas/domain/qemu/1.0'>\n     <qemu:commandline>\n     <qemu:arg value='-cpu'/>\n     <qemu:arg value='host,migratable=off,+invtsc'/>\n     </qemu:commandline>\n     ...\n     </domain>\nNote: The\nhost-passthrough\nmode\nSince\nhost-passthrough\nexposes the physical\n              CPU details to the virtual CPU, migration to dissimilar hardware\n              is not possible. See\nSection 4.5.2.3, “Virtual CPU migration considerations”\nfor\n              more information.\n4.5.2.2\nVirtual CPU pinning\n#\nVirtual CPU pinning is used to constrain virtual CPU threads to a\n            set of physical CPUs. The\nvcpupin\nelement\n            specifies the physical host CPUs that a virtual CPU can use. If\n            this element is not set and the attribute\ncpuset\nof the\nvcpu\nelement is not specified, the\n            virtual CPU is free to use any of the physical CPUs.\nCPU intensive workloads can benefit from virtual CPU pinning by\n            increasing the physical CPU cache hit ratio. To pin a virtual CPU\n            to a specific physical CPU, run the following commands:\n>\nvirsh vcpupin\nDOMAIN_ID\n--vcpu\nvCPU_NUMBER\nVCPU: CPU Affinity\n----------------------------------\n0: 0-7\n#\nvirsh vcpupin SLE15 --vcpu 0 0 --config\nThe last command generates the following entry in the XML\n            configuration:\n<cputune>\n   <vcpupin vcpu='0' cpuset='0'/>\n</cputune>\nNote: Virtual CPU pinning on NUMA nodes\nTo confine a VM Guest's CPUs and its memory to a NUMA node, you\n              can use virtual CPU pinning and memory allocation policies on a\n              NUMA system. See\nSection 4.6, “NUMA tuning”\nfor more\n              information related to NUMA tuning.\nWarning: Virtual CPU pinning and live migration\nEven though\nvcpupin\ncan improve performance,\n              it can complicate live migration. See\nSection 4.5.2.3, “Virtual CPU migration considerations”\nfor\n              more information on virtual CPU migration considerations.\n4.5.2.3\nVirtual CPU migration considerations\n#\nSelecting a virtual CPU model containing all the latest features\n            may improve performance of a VM Guest workload, but often at the\n            expense of migratability. Unless all hosts in the cluster contain\n            the latest CPU features, migration can fail when a destination host\n            lacks the new features. If migratability of a virtual CPU is\n            preferred over the latest CPU features, a normalized CPU model and\n            feature set should be used. The\nvirsh\n            cpu-baseline\ncommand can help define a normalized virtual\n            CPU that can be migrated across all hosts. The following command,\n            when run on each host in the migration cluster, illustrates the\n            collection of all hosts' capabilities in\nall-hosts-caps.xml\n.\n>\nsudo\nvirsh capabilities >> all-hosts-cpu-caps.xml\nWith the capabilities of each host collected in all-hosts-caps.xml,\n            use\nvirsh cpu-baseline\nto create a virtual CPU\n            definition that will be compatible across all hosts.\n>\nsudo\nvirsh cpu-baseline all-hosts-caps.xml\nThe resulting virtual CPU definition can be used as the\ncpu\nelement in the VM Guest configuration file.\nAt a logical level, virtual CPU pinning is a form of hardware\n            pass-through. CPU pinning couples physical resources to virtual\n            resources, which can also be problematic for migration. For\n            example, the migration will fail if the requested physical\n            resources are not available on the destination host, or if the\n            source and destination hosts have different NUMA topologies. For\n            more recommendations about Live Migration, see\nSection 11.7.1, “Migration requirements”\n.\n4.6\nNUMA tuning\n#\nNUMA is an acronym for Non Uniform Memory Access. A NUMA system has\n        multiple physical CPUs, each with local memory attached. Each CPU can\n        also access other CPUs' memory, known as\n“\nremote memory\n        access\n”\n, but it is much slower than accessing local memory. NUMA\n        systems can negatively affect VM Guest performance if not tuned\n        properly. Although ultimately tuning is workload dependent, this\n        section describes controls that should be considered when deploying\n        VM Guests on NUMA hosts. Always consider your host topology when\n        configuring and deploying VMs.\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\ncontains a NUMA auto-balancer that strives to reduce\n        remote memory access by placing memory on the same NUMA node as the CPU\n        processing it.

Automatic NUMA balancing scans a task's address\n          space and unmaps pages. By doing so, it detects whether pages are\n          properly placed or whether to migrate the data to a memory node local\n          to where the task is running. In defined intervals (configured with\nnuma_balancing_scan_delay_ms\n), the task scans the\n          next scan size number of pages (configured with\nnuma_balancing_scan_size_mb\n) in its address space.\n          When the end of the address space is reached, the scanner restarts\n          from the beginning.\nHigher scan rates cause higher system overhead as page faults must be\n          trapped and data needs to be migrated. However, the higher the scan\n          rate, the more quickly a task's memory migrates to a local node when\n          the workload pattern changes. This minimizes the performance impact\n          caused by remote memory accesses. These\nsysctl\ndirectives control the thresholds for scan delays and the number of\n          pages scanned:\n>\nsudo\nsysctl -a | grep numa_balancing\nkernel.numa_balancing = 1\n1\nkernel.numa_balancing_scan_delay_ms = 1000\n2\nkernel.numa_balancing_scan_period_max_ms = 60000\n3\nkernel.numa_balancing_scan_period_min_ms = 1000\n4\nkernel.numa_balancing_scan_size_mb = 256\n5\n1\nEnables/disables automatic page fault-based NUMA balancing\n2\nStarting scan delay used for a task when it initially forks\n3\nMaximum time in milliseconds to scan a task's virtual memory\n4\nMinimum time in milliseconds to scan a task's virtual memory\n5\nSize in megabytes' worth of pages to be scanned for a given scan\nFor more information, see\nChapter 11,\nAutomatic Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) balancing\n.\nThe main goal of automatic NUMA balancing is either to reschedule\n          tasks on the same node's memory (so the CPU follows the memory), or\n          to copy the memory's pages to the same node (so the memory follows\n          the CPU).\nWarning: Task placement\nThere are no rules to define the best place to run a task, because\n            tasks could share memory with other tasks. For the best\n            performance, we recommend to group tasks sharing memory on the same\n            node. Check NUMA statistics with\n# cat /proc/vmstat | grep\n            numa_\n.\n4.6.2\nMemory allocation control with the CPUset controller\n#\nThe cgroups cpuset controller can be used confine memory used by a\n          process to a NUMA node. There are three cpuset memory policy modes\n          available:\ninterleave\n: this is a memory placement policy\n              which is also known as round-robin. This policy can provide\n              substantial improvements for jobs that need to place thread local\n              data on the corresponding node. When the interleave destination\n              is not available, it will be moved to another node.\nbind\n: this will place memory only on one node,\n              which means in case of insufficient memory, the allocation will\n              fail.\npreferred\n: this policy will apply a preference\n              to allocate memory to a node. If there is not enough space for\n              memory on this node, it will fall back to another node.\nYou can change the memory policy mode with the\ncgset\ntool from the\nlibcgroup-tools\npackage:\n>\nsudo\ncgset -r cpuset.mems=\nNODE\nsysdefault/libvirt/qemu/\nKVM_NAME\n/emulator\nTo migrate pages to a node, use the\nmigratepages\ntool:\n>\nmigratepages\nPID\nFROM-NODE\nTO-NODE\nTo check everything is fine. use:\ncat\n          /proc/\nPID\n/status | grep Cpus\n.\nNote: Kernel NUMA/cpuset memory policy\nFor more information see\nKernel\n            NUMA memory policy\nand\ncpusets\n            memory policy\n.

They can be created, maintained and queried with the\nqemu-img\ncommand. Refer to\nSection 34.2.2, “Creating, converting, and checking disk images”\nfor more\n      information on the\nqemu-img\ntool and examples.\n5.1\nVM Guest image formats\n#\nCertain storage formats which QEMU recognizes have their origins in\n        other virtualization technologies. By recognizing these formats, QEMU\n        can leverage either data stores or entire guests that were originally\n        targeted to run under these other virtualization technologies. Some\n        formats are supported only in read-only mode. To use them in read/write\n        mode, convert them to a fully supported QEMU storage format (using\nqemu-img\n). Otherwise they can only be used as\n        read-only data store in a QEMU guest.\nUse\nqemu-img info\nVMGUEST.IMG\nto get information\n        about an existing image, such as: the format, the virtual size, the\n        physical size, snapshots if available.\nNote: Performance\nIt is recommended to convert the disk images to either raw or qcow2\n          to achieve good performance.\nWarning: Encrypted images cannot be compressed\nWhen you create an image, you cannot use compression\n          (\n-c\n) in the output file together with the encryption\n          option (\n-e\n).\n5.1.1\nRaw format\n#\nThis format is simple and easily exportable to all other\n              emulators/hypervisors.\nIt provides best performance (least I/O overhead).\nIt occupies all allocated space on the file system.\nThe raw format allows to copy a VM Guest image to a physical\n              device (\ndd if=\nVMGUEST.RAW\nof=\n/dev/sda\n).\nIt is byte-for-byte the same as what the VM Guest sees, so this\n              wastes a lot of space.\n5.1.2\nqcow2 format\n#\nUse this to have smaller images (useful if your file system does\n              not supports holes).\nIt has optional AES encryption (now deprecated).\nZlib-based compression option.\nSupport of multiple VM snapshots (internal, external).\nImproved performance and stability.\nSupports changing the backing file.\nSupports consistency checks.\nLess performance than raw format.\nl2-cache-size\nqcow2 can provide the same performance for random read/write\n                access as raw format, but it needs a well-sized cache size. By\n                default cache size is set to 1 MB. This will give good\n                performance up to a disk size of 8 GB. If you need a bigger\n                disk size, you need to adjust the cache size. For a disk size\n                of 64 GB (64*1024 = 65536), you need 65536 / 8192B = 8 MB of\n                cache (\n-drive format=qcow2,l2-cache-size=8M\n).\nCluster size\nThe qcow2 format offers the capability to change the cluster\n                size. The value must be between 512 KB and 2 MB.\n                Smaller cluster sizes can improve the image file size whereas\n                larger cluster sizes generally provide better performance.\nPreallocation\nAn image with preallocated metadata is initially larger but can\n                improve performance when the image needs to grow.\nLazy refcounts\nReference count updates are postponed with the goal of avoiding\n                metadata I/O and improving performance. This is particularly\n                beneficial with\ncache=writethrough\n. This\n                option does not batch metadata updates, but if in case of host\n                crash, the reference count tables must be rebuilt, this is done\n                automatically at the next open with\nqemu-img check -r\n                all\n. Note that this takes some time.\n5.1.3\nqed format\n#\nqed is a follow-on qcow (QEMU Copy On Write) format. Because qcow2\n          provides all the benefits of qed and more, qed is now deprecated.\n5.1.4\nVMDK format\n#\nVMware 3, 4, or 6 image format, for exchanging images with that\n          product.\n5.2\nOverlay disk images\n#\nThe qcow2 and qed formats provide a way to create a base image (also\n        called backing file) and overlay images on top of the base image. A\n        backing file is useful to be able to revert to a known state and\n        discard the overlay. If you write to the image, the backing image will\n        be untouched and all changes will be recorded in the overlay image\n        file. The backing file will never be modified unless you use the\ncommit\nmonitor command (or\nqemu-img\n        commit\n).\nTo create an overlay image:\n#\nqemu-img create -o\n1\nbacking_file=vmguest.raw\n2\n,backing_fmt=raw\n3\n\\\n     -f\n4\nqcow2 vmguest.cow\n5\n1\nUse\n-o ?\nfor an overview of available options.\n2\nThe backing file name.\n3\nSpecify the file format for the backing file.\n4\nSpecify the image format for the VM Guest.\n5\nImage name of the VM Guest, it will only record the differences\n            from the backing file.\nWarning: Backing image path\nYou should not change the path to the backing image, otherwise you\n          will need to adjust it. The path is stored in the overlay image file.\n          To update the path, you should make a symbolic link from the original\n          path to the new path and then use the\nqemu-img\nrebase\noption.\n#\nln -sf /var/lib/images/\nOLD_PATH\n/vmguest.raw  \\\n /var/lib/images/\nNEW_PATH\n/vmguest.raw\n#\nqemu-img rebase\n1\n-u\n2\n-b\n3\n\\\n /var/lib/images/\nOLD_PATH\n/vmguest.raw /var/lib/images/\nNEW_PATH\n/vmguest.cow\n1\nThe\nrebase\nsubcommand tells\nqemu-img\nto change the backing file image.\n2\nThe\n-u\noption activates the unsafe mode (see\n              note below). There are two different modes in which\nrebase\ncan operate:\nSafe\n: This is the default mode and\n                  performs a real rebase operation. The safe mode is a\n                  time-consuming operation.\nUnsafe\n: The unsafe mode\n                  (\n-u\n) only changes the backing files name and\n                  the format of the file name without making any checks on the\n                  files contents. You should use this mode to rename or moving\n                  a backing file.\n3\nThe backing image to be used is specified with\n-b\nand the image path is the last argument of\n              the command.\nA common use is to initiate a new guest with the backing file. Let's\n        assume we have a\nsle15_base.img\nVM Guest ready to\n        be used (fresh installation without any modification). This will be our\n        backing file. Now you need to test a new package, on an updated system\n        and on a system with a different kernel. We can use\nsle15_base.img\nto instantiate the new SUSE Linux Enterprise\n        VM Guest by creating a qcow2 overlay file pointing to this backing\n        file (\nsle15_base.img\n).\nIn our example we will use\nsle15_updated.qcow2\nfor\n        the updated system, and\nsle15_kernel.qcow2\nfor the\n        system with a different kernel.\nTo create the two thin provisioned systems use the\nqemu-img\ncommand line with the\n-b\noption:\n#\nqemu-img create -b /var/lib/libvirt/sle15_base.img -f qcow2 \\\n/var/lib/libvirt/sle15_updated.qcow2\nFormatting 'sle15_updated.qcow2', fmt=qcow2 size=17179869184\nbacking_file='sle15_base.img' encryption=off cluster_size=65536\nlazy_refcounts=off nocow=off\n#\nqemu-img create -b /var/lib/libvirt/sle15_base.img -f qcow2 \\\n/var/lib/libvirt/sle15_kernel.qcow2\nFormatting 'sle15_kernel.qcow2', fmt=qcow2 size=17179869184\nbacking_file='vmguest-sle15_base.img' encryption=off cluster_size=65536\nlazy_refcounts=off nocow=off\nThe images are now usable, and you can do your test without touching\n        the initial\nsle15_base.img\nbacking file.

In the following\n        example we will share the\n/data/shared\ndirectory\n        and mount it in the VM Guest. Note that the\naccessmode\nparameter only works with\ntype='mount'\nfor the QEMU/KVM driver\n        (most other values for\ntype\nare\n        exclusively used for the LXC driver).\n<filesystem type='mount'\n1\naccessmode='mapped'\n2\n>\n   <source dir='/data/shared'\n3\n>\n   <target dir='shared'\n4\n/>\n</filesystem>\n1\nA host directory to mount VM Guest.\n2\nAccess mode (the security mode) set to\nmapped\nwill give access with the permissions of the hypervisor.

The virtualization\n        standard for such drivers for KVM are the\nvirtio\ndrivers, which are designed for running in a virtual environment. Xen\n        uses similar paravirtualized device drivers (like\nVMDP\nin a Windows* guest).\n6.1.1\nvirtio blk\n#\nvirtio_blk\nis the virtio block device for disk. To\n          use the\nvirtio blk\ndriver for a block device,\n          specify the\nbus='virtio'\nattribute in\n          the\ndisk\ndefinition:\n<disk type='....' device='disk'>\n    ....\n    <target dev='vda' bus='virtio'/>\n</disk>\nImportant: Disk device names\nvirtio\ndisk devices are named\n/dev/vd[a-z][1-9]\n. If you migrate a Linux guest\n            from a non-virtio disk you need to adjust the\nroot=\nparameter in the GRUB configuration, and\n            regenerate the\ninitrd\nfile. Otherwise the\n            system cannot boot. On VM Guests with other operating systems, the\n            boot loader may need to be adjusted or reinstalled accordingly,\n            too.\nImportant: Using\nvirtio\ndisks with\nqemu-system-ARCH\nWhen running\nqemu-system-ARCH\n, use the\n-drive\noption to add a disk to the VM Guest. See\nSection 34.1, “Basic installation with\nqemu-system-ARCH\n”\nfor an example. The\n-hd[abcd]\noption will not work for virtio disks.\n6.1.2\nvirtio net\n#\nvirtio_net\nis the virtio network device. The\n          kernel modules should be loaded automatically in the guest at boot\n          time. You need to start the service to make the network available.\n<interface type='network'>\n    ...\n    <model type='virtio' />\n</interface>\n6.1.3\nvirtio balloon\n#\nThe virtio balloon is used for host memory over-commits for guests.\n          For Linux guests, the balloon driver runs in the guest kernel,\n          whereas for Windows guests, the balloon driver is in the VMDP\n          package.\nvirtio_balloon\nis a PV driver to give or\n          take memory from a VM Guest.\nInflate balloon\n: Return memory from guest to\n              host kernel (for KVM) or to hypervisor (for Xen)\nDeflate balloon\n: Guest will have more\n              available memory\nIt is controlled by the\ncurrentMemory\nand\nmemory\noptions.\n<memory unit='KiB'>16777216</memory>\n    <currentMemory unit='KiB'>1048576</currentMemory>\n    [...]\n    <devices>\n        <memballoon model='virtio'/>\n    </devices>\nYou can also use\nvirsh\nto change it:\n>\nvirsh setmem\nDOMAIN_ID\nMEMORY in KB\n6.1.4\nChecking virtio presence\n#\nYou can check the virtio block PCI with:\n>\nfind /sys/devices/ -name virtio*\n/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:06.0/virtio0\n/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:07.0/virtio1\n/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:08.0/virtio2\nTo find the block device associated with\nvdX\n:\n>\nfind /sys/devices/ -name virtio* -print  -exec ls {}/block 2>/dev/null \\;\n/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:06.0/virtio0\n/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:07.0/virtio1\n/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:08.0/virtio2\nvda\nTo get more information on the virtio block:\n>\nudevadm info -p /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:08.0/virtio2\nP: /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:08.0/virtio2\nE: DEVPATH=/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:08.0/virtio2\nE: DRIVER=virtio_blk\nE: MODALIAS=virtio:d00000002v00001AF4\nE: SUBSYSTEM=virtio\nTo check all virtio drivers being used:\n>\nfind /sys/devices/ -name virtio* -print  -exec ls -l {}/driver 2>/dev/null \\;\n/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:06.0/virtio0\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jun 17 15:48 /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:06.0/virtio0/driver -> ../../../../bus/virtio/drivers/virtio_console\n/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:07.0/virtio1\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jun 17 15:47 /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:07.0/virtio1/driver -> ../../../../bus/virtio/drivers/virtio_balloon\n/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:08.0/virtio2\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jun 17 14:35 /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:08.0/virtio2/driver -> ../../../../bus/virtio/drivers/virtio_blk\n6.1.5\nFind device driver options\n#\nVirtio devices and other drivers have various options.

On the host side, it\n        can be wired up to one of several sources of entropy (including a real\n        hardware RNG device and the host's\n/dev/random\n) if\n        hardware support does not exist. The Linux kernel contains the guest\n        driver for the device from version 2.6.26 and higher.\nThe system entropy is collected from various non-deterministic hardware\n        events and is mainly used by cryptographic applications. The virtual\n        random number generator device (paravirtualized device) allows the host\n        to pass through entropy to VM Guest operating systems. This results in\n        a better entropy in the VM Guest.\nTo use Virtio RNG, add an\nRNG\ndevice in\nvirt-manager\nor directly in the VM Guest's XML\n        configuration:\n<devices>\n   <rng model='virtio'>\n       <backend model='random'>/dev/random</backend>\n   </rng>\n</devices>\nThe host now should used\n/dev/random\n:\n>\nlsof /dev/random\nqemu-syst 4926 qemu    6r   CHR    1,8      0t0 8199 /dev/random\nOn the VM Guest, the source of entropy can be checked with:\n>\ncat /sys/devices/virtual/misc/hw_random/rng_available\nThe current device used for entropy can be checked with:\n>\ncat /sys/devices/virtual/misc/hw_random/rng_current\nvirtio_rng.0\nYou should install the\nrng-tools\npackage on the\n        VM Guest, enable the service, and start it. Under\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n15, do\n        the following:\n#\nzypper in rng-tools\n#\nsystemctl enable rng-tools\n#\nsystemctl start rng-tools\n6.4\nDisable unused tools and devices\n#\nPer host, use one virtualization technology only. For example, do not\n        use KVM and Xen on the same host. Otherwise, you may find yourself\n        with a reduced amount of available resources, increased security risk\n        and a longer software update queue. Even when the amount of resources\n        allocated to each of the technologies is configured carefully, the host\n        may suffer from reduced overall availability and degraded performance.\nMinimize the amount of software and services available on hosts. Most\n        default installations of operating systems are not optimized for VM\n        usage.

As changes\n        or improvements to QEMU are made, new machine types are added. Old\n        machine types are still supported for compatibility reasons, but to\n        take advantage of improvements, we recommend to always migrate to the\n        latest machine type when upgrading.\nChanging the guest's machine type for a Linux guest will mostly be\n        transparent. For Windows* guests, we recommend to take a snapshot or\n        backup of the guest—in case Windows* has issues with the changes\n        it detects and subsequently the user decides to revert to the original\n        machine type the guest was created with.\nNote: Changing the machine type\nRefer to\nSection 15.2, “Changing the machine type”\nfor\n          documentation.\n7\nVM Guest-specific configurations and settings\n#\nNote\nThis section applies to QEMU / KVM hypervisor only.\n7.1\nACPI testing\n#\nThe ability to change a VM Guest's state heavily depends on the\n        operating system. It is very important to test this feature before any\n        use of your VM Guests in production. For example, most Linux operating\n        systems disable this capability by default, so this requires you to\n        enable this operation (mostly through Polkit).\nACPI must be enabled in the guest for a graceful shutdown to work. To\n        check if ACPI is enabled, run:\n>\nvirsh dumpxml\nVMNAME\n| grep acpi\nIf nothing is printed, ACPI is not enabled for your machine. Use\nvirsh edit\nto add the following XML under\n        <domain>:\n<features>\n   <acpi/>\n</features>\nIf ACPI was enabled during a Windows Server* guest\n        installation, it is not sufficient to turn it on in the VM Guest\n        configuration only. For more information, see\nhttps://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/309283\n.\nRegardless of the VM Guest's configuration, a graceful shutdown is\n        always possible from within the guest operating system.\n7.2\nKeyboard layout\n#\nThough it is possible to specify the keyboard layout from a\nqemu-system-ARCH\ncommand, it is recommended to\n        configure it in the\nlibvirt\nXML file. To change the keyboard layout\n        while connecting to a remote VM Guest using vnc, you should edit the\n        VM Guest XML configuration file. For example, to add an\nen-us\nkeymap, add in the\n<devices>\nsection:\n<graphics type='vnc' port='-1' autoport='yes' keymap='en-us'/>\nCheck the\nvncdisplay\nconfiguration and connect to\n        your VM Guest:\n>\nvirsh vncdisplay sles15 127.0.0.1:0\n7.3\nSpice default listen URL\n#\nIf no network interface other than\nlo\nis assigned an\n        IPv4 address on the host, the default address on which the spice server\n        listens will not work.

This avoids improper multiple parallel\n        accesses to the same block device from software components on local or\n        remote hosts, which could lead to device damage and data corruption.\nFind more information on managing storage multipath I/O in\nChapter 18,\nManaging multipath I/O for devices\n. Find more information about SCSI\n        persistent reservations in\nSection 18.6.4, “SCSI persistent reservations and\nmpathpersist\n”\n.\nFor the virtualization scenario, QEMU's SCSI passthrough devices\nscsi-block\nand\nscsi-generic\nsupport passing guest persistent reservation requests to a privileged\n        external helper program\nqemu-pr-helper\n. It needs to\n        start before QEMU and creates a listener socket that accepts incoming\n        connections for communication with QEMU.\nNote: Live migration scenario with multipathed devices\nWe recommend using the multipath alias instead of\nwwid\n. It is useful in the VM Guest live migration\n          scenario, because it makes sure that the storage paths are identical\n          between the source and destination hosts.\nProcedure 11:\nAdding a SCSI persistent reservation in a VM Guest against the related multipathed device in the VM Host Server:\n#\nIn the VM Host Server, create a multipath environment. For more\n            information, refer to\nSection 18.7, “Configuring the system for multipathing”\nand\nSection 18.8, “Multipath configuration”\n.\nIn the VM Host Server, configure the\n<reservations/>\nsub-element of the\n<source/>\nelement of the\n<disk/>\nelement for the passed-through lun in\n            your\nlibvirt\ndomain configuration.

Otherwise, you need to\n                  manually add a virtio-scsi HBA to avoid automatically adding\n                  the LSI HBA by\nlibvirt\n.

You can choose\n   what packages and components to install based on a specific use case. To\n   that end, SLES Minimal VM provides access to all regular software repositories.\nIf you already have SUSE Linux Enterprise Server certification, you are automatically certified for\n   SLES Minimal VM, as it is derived from the same code base. SLES Minimal VM allows you to\n   reduce the operating system to the packages essential for the specific usage\n   scenario. This minimizes the number of packages and patches that need to be\n   managed and applied. By removing unnecessary packages, you also reduce the\n   number of potential vulnerabilities, thus making the resulting system more\n   secure. Reducing the system's footprint also results in lower resource\n   consumption and improved performance.\nSLES Minimal VM is delivered as pre-configured and ready-to-run virtual machine\n   images. The system comes with the\njeos-firstboot\nwizard for configuring system locales and the root password during the first\n   boot. SLES Minimal VM ships with the SSH server enabled and excluded from the\n   firewall configuration. The supplied KIWI NG templates make it possible to\n   create customized SLES Minimal VM images.\nSLES Minimal VM provides ready-to-deploy server images on the AMD64/Intel 64 architecture\n   for the following usage scenarios:\nKVM/Xen with HVM\nXen Paravirtualized\nMicrosoft Hyper-V\nVMware\nOpenStack Cloud\n1.1\nSystem requirements\n#\nThe minimum SLES Minimal VM system requirements are similar to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. For more\n    information, refer to\nSection 2.1, “Hardware requirements”\n.\n1.2\nDifferences between SLES Minimal VM and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n#\nThere are several significant differences between SLES Minimal VM and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server.\nDifferences between SLES Minimal VM and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n#\njeos-firstboot\nSLES Minimal VM comes with the\njeos-firstboot\ntool, which can\n       be used to configure basic settings during the first boot. This includes\n       keyboard layout and language, time zone, and root password.\nThe default network configuration is set to use DHCP, and the system\n       automatically creates a Btrfs snapshot of the initial configuration.\nkernel-default-base\nBecause of size constraints, SLES Minimal VM images use the\nkernel-default-base\nas the default kernel. Since the\n       kernel does not contain drivers for bare metal, this allows for a\n       smaller footprint.\nIf a specific usage scenario requires any of the omitted modules,\n       install the\nkernel-default\npackage to get a full tree\n       of the kernel modules. This is the same kernel used by a regular SUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n       installation.\nNo repositories by default\nWhen installing a SUSE Linux Enterprise Server from the installation media, the system\n       automatically sets the installation media as the default offline\n       channel.\nSLES Minimal VM has no channel by default, and you need to register your system to\n       access online channels. Refer to\nSection 9.3.2, “Registering with SUSEConnect”\nfor further information.\nNote\nThe\njeos-firstboot\n,\njeos-licenses\n, and\nlive-langset-data\nreceive updates only if the Development Tools Module is enabled. However, these packages are not essential for running SLES Minimal VM instances, so they can be removed or left untouched.\nZypper configuration\nSLES Minimal VM is a slimmed-down version of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. The reduction in size is\n       achieved in part by enabling the following two options in\n/etc/zypp/zypp.conf\n:\nrpm.install.excludedocs = yes\n(excludes all files\n       marked as documentation from being installed by default) and\nsolver.onlyRequires = true\n(disables installation of\n       suggested and recommended packages by default).\nBase packages\nSLES Minimal VM images are built using the KIWI NG tool. KIWI NG's configuration\n       files, called templates, explicitly list packages that must be included\n       in the images. Keep in mind that these base packages pull their\n       dependencies during the image building process. Therefore, the list of\n       preinstalled packages in an image usually contains more packages than\n       the list of base packages.\nThe KIWI NG configuration files used to create the official SLES Minimal VM images\n       are available from the openSUSE Build Service at\nhttps://build.opensuse.org/\n.\nNote: Specific host tools packages\nEach SLES Minimal VM flavor contains certain host tools packages. Refer to\n        the specific flavors section in the documentation for further\n        information.\nDisk layout\nUnlike SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, which calculates the disk layout during installation,\n       SLES Minimal VM features the following fixed virtual image partitioning scheme:\n2 MB BIOS boot\n33 MB EFI system\n24 GB Linux file system\nTo get additional disk space, you can either extend the existing disk\n       from the virtual host or add a secondary disk to the virtual machine. If\n       you choose the latter option, you must partition and format it manually.\nsystemd-coredump disabled\nDue to the limited amount of memory and disk space available by default\n       on SLES Minimal VM images, systemd-coredump is disabled by default on SLES Minimal VM images.\n       To collect application core dumps necessary for troubleshooting, follow\n       these steps:\nInstall the\nsystemd-coredump\npackage, which\n         contains\n/usr/lib/sysctl.d/50-coredump.conf\nTo apply the configuration changes to your system, reboot or use the\nsysctl --system\ncommand.\nFor further information, refer to\nhttps://documentation.suse.com/sles/html/SLES-all/cha-tuning-systemd-coredump.html\n.\n2\nAvailable image flavors\n#\nReady-to-use SLES Minimal VM images are available for the x86_64 architecture only.\n   You can download SLES Minimal VM for the following deployment targets:\nFully Virtual SLES Minimal VM for KVM and Xen (FV/HVM)\nSLES Minimal VM for VMware\nSLES Minimal VM for Microsoft Hyper-V\nSLES Minimal VM for OpenStack\nParavirtual SLES Minimal VM for Xen (PV)\nImportant: Supported virtualization hosts (hypervisors)\nSLES Minimal VM can run as a virtualization guest on the same virtualization hosts\n    (hypervisors) as SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. See\nSection 7.3, “Supported host environments (hypervisors)”\nfor more\n    information on what hypervisors are supported.\n2.1\nSLES Minimal VM Image for OpenStack Cloud\n#\nSLES Minimal VM for OpenStack Cloud is an image designed specifically for use in an\n    OpenStack environment.\nInstead of the\njeos-firstboot\ntool, SLES Minimal VM for OpenStack\n    Cloud uses\ncloud-init\nfor configuring the image. The image also uses the XFS file system and the\n    following kernel configuration:\n\"plymouth.enable=0 console=ttyS0,115200 console=tty0 net.ifnames=0\"\nThis means that the image ships without packages required by\njeos-firstboot\nand Btrfs.\nSLES Minimal VM for OpenStack Cloud includes several OpenStack-related packages,\n    such as\ncloud-init\n,\ncloud-init-config-suse\n, and\nxfsprogs\n.\n2.1.1\ncloud-init\nbasics\n#\ncloud-init\nautomatically applies custom configuration\n     to running instances. The tool features a wide range of configuration\n     modules, and it can execute specific commands in the image during the boot\n     phase.\nThe default configuration for cloud-init is part of the\ncloud-init-config-suse\npackage, and it is located in\n     the\n/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg\ndirectory.\n2.1.2\ncloud-init configuration examples\n#\nBy default, cloud-init does not set a root password. Instead it creates a user account called\nsles\nthat acts as the default user and has sudo rights. Use the following example to create passwords for both users.\nExample 1:\nAdd passwords\n#\n#cloud-config\nchpasswd:\n  list: |\n    root:$6$SalTsaLt$miA./Q1i1mKR0sYicn/yAzNHP6y32JjOdVIn5agAiaEKaSaZdC3X6CVTW2d/xslQfevCc20teWLurq12x8mbe1\n    sles:$6$SalTsaLt$.cuqsgjNGxHJZSLmVqkI/j9.kWIiUQHqjlRswbHjTw9hIXdPomgey2DHzmp6Ho6wgqIKz3ufbOIKdQCnQHPSA1\n  expire: False\nTo create the SHA-512 hashes used in the example, run the command:\nopenssl passwd -6 -salt SalTsaLt\nPASSWORD\n.\nWarning: User passwords\nTo avoid potential security risks, do not use passwords in production\n      environments. Even when using hashed passwords, you are exposed to\n      dictionary attacks. For better security, use SSH authentication instead\n      of passwords.\nWhen creating users, keep in mind that logging in with a password is\n     disabled by default, and that the newly-created users do not have sudo\n     rights.\nThe following examples show configurations for creating various users.\nExample 2:\nNew user with password and sudo\n#\n#cloud-config\nusers:\n  - default\n  - name:\nUSER\nshell: /bin/bash\n    groups: users\n    # lock_passwd: Disable password login.

Along with the Custom Resources, KubeVirt includes controllers\n        and agents that provide virtual machine management capabilities on the\n        cluster. By using this mechanism, the Kubernetes API can be used to\n        manage virtual machine resources similar to other Kubernetes resources.\nAuthors:\nJim\nFehlig\nand\nVasily\nUlyanov\nRevision History: SUSE Linux Enterprise Server Documentation\n1\nKubeVirt components\n#\nKubeVirt consists of two RPM-based packages and six container images\n      that provide the Kubernetes virtual machine management extension. The RPM\n      packages include\nkubevirt-virtctl\nand\nkubevirt-manifests\n. The container images include\nvirt-api\n,\nvirt-controller\n,\nvirt-handler\n,\nvirt-launcher\n, and\nvirt-operator\n,\nlibguestfs-tools\n.\nkubevirt-virtctl\ncan be installed on any machine with\n      administrator access to the cluster. It contains the\nvirtctl\ntool, which provides syntactic sugar on top of\n      the\nkubectl\ntool for virtual machine resources.\n      Although the\nkubectl\ntool can be used to manage\n      virtual machines, it is a bit awkward since, unlike standard Kubernetes\n      resources, virtual machines maintain state. Migration is also unique to\n      virtual machines. If a standard Kubernetes resource needs to be evacuated\n      from a cluster node, it is destroyed and started again on an alternate\n      node. Since virtual machines are stateful, they cannot be destroyed and\n      must be live-migrated away if a node is under evacuation. The\nvirtctl\ntool abstracts the complexity of managing\n      virtual machines with\nkubectl\n. It can be used to stop,\n      start, pause, unpause and migrate virtual machines.\nvirtclt\nalso provides access to the virtual machine's\n      serial console and graphics server.\nkubevirt-manifests\ncontains the manifests, or recipes,\n      for installing KubeVirt. The most interesting files are\n/usr/share/kube-virt/manifests/release/kubevirt-cr.yaml\nand\n/usr/share/kube-virt/manifests/release/kubevirt-operator.yaml\n.\nkubevirt-cr.yaml\ncontains the KubeVirt Custom\n      Resource definition that represents the KubeVirt service.\nkubevirt-operator.yaml\nis the recipe for deploying\n      the KubeVirt operator, which deploys the KubeVirt service to the\n      cluster and manages its' lifecycle.\nvirt-api\nis a cluster component that provides the\n      Kubernetes API extension for virtual machine resources. Like\nvirt-api\n,\nvirt-controller\nis a\n      cluster component that watches for new objects created via\nvirt-api\n, or updates to existing objects, and takes\n      action to ensure the object state matches the requested state.\nvirt-handler\nis a DaemonSet and a node component that\n      has the job of keeping the cluster-level virtual machine object in sync\n      with the\nlibvirtd\ndomain running in\nvirt-launcher\n.\nvirt-handler\ncan\n      also perform node-centric operations like configuring networking and/or\n      storage on the node per the virtual machine specification.\nvirt-launcher\nis also a node component and has the job\n      of running\nlibvirt\nplus\nqemu\nto\n      provide the virtual machine environment.\nvirt-launcher\nis a lowly pod resource.\nlibguestfs-tools\nis a\n      component providing a set of utilities for accessing and modifying VM\n      disk images.\nvirt-operator\nimplements the Kubernetes operator\n      pattern. Operators encode the human knowledge required to deploy, run\n      and maintain an application. Operators are a Kubernetes Deployment\n      resource type and are often used to manage the custom resources and\n      custom controllers that together provide a more complex Kubernetes\n      application such as KubeVirt.\n2\nInstalling KubeVirt on Kubernetes\n#\nKubeVirt can be installed on a Kubernetes cluster by installing the\nkubevirt-manifests\npackage on an admin node, applying\n      the\nvirt-operator\nmanifest, and creating the\n      KubeVirt custom resource. For example, on a cluster admin node execute\n      the following:\n>\nsudo\nzypper install kubevirt-manifests\n>\nkubectl apply -f /usr/share/kube-virt/manifests/release/kubevirt-operator.yaml\n>\nkubectl apply -f /usr/share/kube-virt/manifests/release/kubevirt-cr.yaml\nAfter creating the KubeVirt custom resource,\nvirt-operator\ndeploys the remaining KubeVirt\n      components. Progress can be monitored by viewing the status of the\n      resources in the\nkubevirt\nnamespace:\n>\nkubectl get all -n kubevirt\nThe cluster is ready to deploy virtual machines once\nvirt-api\n,\nvirt-controller\n, and\nvirt-handler\nare READY with STATUS\n“\nRunning\n”\n.\nAlternatively it is possible to wait until KubeVirt custom resource\n      becomes available:\n>\nkubectl -n kubevirt wait kv kubevirt --for condition=Available\nSome KubeVirt functionality is disabled by default and must be enabled\n      via feature gates. For example, live migration and the use of HostDisk for\n      virtual machine disk images are disabled. Enabling KubeVirt feature\n      gates can be done by altering an existing KubeVirt custom resource and\n      specifying the list of features to enable. For example, you can enable\n      live migration and the use of HostDisks:\n>\nkubectl edit kubevirt kubevirt -n kubevirt\n    ...\n    spec:\n      configuration:\n        developerConfiguration:\n          featureGates:\n            - HostDisk\n            - LiveMigration\nNote\nThe names of feature gates are case-sensitive.\n3\nUpdating the KubeVirt deployment\n#\nUpdating KubeVirt is similar to the initial installation. The updated\n      operator manifest from the\nkubevirt-manifests\npackage\n      is applied to the cluster.\n>\nsudo\nzypper update kubevirt-manifests\n>\nkubectl apply -f /usr/share/kube-virt/manifests/release/kubevirt-operator.yaml\n4\nDeleting KubeVirt from a cluster\n#\nKubeVirt can be deleted from a cluster by deleting the custom resource\n      and operator:\n>\nkubectl delete -n kubevirt kubevirt kubevirt # or alternatively: kubectl delete -f /usr/share/kube-virt/manifests/release/kubevirt-cr.yaml\n>\nkubectl delete -f /usr/share/kube-virt/manifests/release/kubevirt-operator.yaml\nNote\nIt is important to delete the custom resource first otherwise it\n        gets stuck in the\nTerminating\nstate. To fix that the\n        resource finalizer needs to be manually deleted:\n>\nkubectl -n kubevirt patch kv kubevirt --type=json -p '[{ \"op\": \"remove\", \"path\": \"/metadata/finalizers\" }]'\nAfter deleting the resources from Kubernetes cluster the installed\n      KubeVirt RPMs can be removed from the system:\n>\nsudo\nzypper rm kubevirt-manifests kubevirt-virtctl\n5\nContainerized Data Importer\n#\nContainerized Data Importer (CDI) is an add-on for Kubernetes focused on\n      persistent storage management. It is primarily used for building and\n      importing Virtual Machine Disks for KubeVirt.\n5.1\nInstalling CDI\n#\nCDI can be installed on a Kubernetes cluster in a way similar to\n        KubeVirt by installing the RPMs and applying the operator and custom\n        resource manifests using kubectl:\n>\nsudo\nzypper in containerized-data-importer-manifests\n>\nkubectl apply -f /usr/share/cdi/manifests/release/cdi-operator.yaml\n>\nkubectl apply -f /usr/share/cdi/manifests/release/cdi-cr.yaml\n5.2\nUpdating and deleting CDI:\n#\nTo update CDI:\n>\nsudo\nzypper update containerized-data-importer-manifests\n>\nkubectl apply -f /usr/share/cdi/manifests/release/cdi-operator.yaml\nTo delete CDI:\n>\nkubectl delete -f /usr/share/cdi/manifests/release/cdi-cr.yaml\n>\nkubectl delete -f /usr/share/cdi/manifests/release/cdi-operator.yaml\n>\nsudo\nzypper rm containerized-data-importer-manifests\n6\nRunning virtual machines\n#\nTwo of the most interesting custom resources provided by KubeVirt are\nVirtualMachine\n(VM) and\nVirtualMachineInstance\n(VMI). As\n      the names imply, a VMI is a running instance of a VM. The lifecycle of a\n      VMI can be managed independently from a VM, but long-lived, stateful\n      virtual machines are managed as a VM. The VM is deployed to the cluster\n      in a shutoff state, then activated by changing the desired state to\n      running. Changing a VM resource state can be done with the standard\n      Kubernetes client tool\nkubectl\nor with the client\nvirtctl\nprovided by KubeVirt.\nThe VM and VMI custom resources make up part of the KubeVirt API. To\n      create a virtual machine, a VM or VMI manifest must be created that\n      adheres to the API. The API supports setting a wide variety of the common\n      virtual machine attributes, for example, model of vCPU, number of vCPUs,\n      amount of memory, disks, network ports, etc. Below is a simple example of\n      a VMI manifest for a virtual machine with one Nehalem CPU, 2G of memory,\n      one disk, and one network interface:\napiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1\nkind: VirtualMachineInstance\nmetadata:\n  labels:\n    special: vmi-host-disk\n  name: sles15sp2\nspec:\n  domain:\n    cpu:\n      model: Nehalem-IBRS\n    devices:\n      disks:\n      - disk:\n          bus: virtio\n        name: host-disk\n      interfaces:\n        - name: green\n          masquerade: {}\n          ports:\n            - port: 80\n    machine:\n      type: \"\"\n    resources:\n      requests:\n        memory: 2048M\n  terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 0\n  networks:\n  - name: green\n    pod: {}\n  volumes:\n  - hostDisk:\n      path: /hostDisks/sles15sp2/disk.raw\n      type: Disk\n      shared: true\n    name: host-disk\nApplying this VMI manifest to the cluster creates a virt-launcher\n      container running\nlibvirt\nand\nqemu\n,\n      providing the familiar KVM virtual machine environment.\n>\nkubectl apply -f sles15sp2vmi.yaml\n>\nkubectl get vmis\nSimilar to other Kubernetes resources, VMs and VMIs can be managed with\n      the\nkubectl\nclient tool. Any\nkubectl\noperation that works with resource types\n      works with the KubeVirt custom resources, for example, describe, delete,\n      get, log, patch, etc. VM resources are a bit more awkward to manage with\nkubectl\n. Since a VM resource can be in a shutoff\n      state, turning it on requires patching the manifest to change the desired\n      state to running. Find an example below:\n>\nkubectl patch vm sles15sp2 --type merge -p '{\"spec\":{\"running\":true}}'\nThe\nvirtctl\ntool included in the\nkubevirt-virtclt\npackage provides syntactic sugar on\n      top of\nkubectl\nfor VM and VMI resources, allowing them\n      to be stopped, started, paused, unpaused and migrated.\nvirtctl\nalso provides access to the virtual machine's\n      serial console and graphics server. Find an example below:\n>\nvirtctl start VM\n>\nvirtctl console VMI\n>\nvirtctl stop VM\n>\nvirtctl pause VM|VMI\n>\nvirtctl unpause VM|VMI\n>\nvirtctl vnc VMI\n>\nvirtctl migrate VM\n7\nLive migration\n#\nKubeVirt supports live migration of VMs. Though this functionality must\n      first be activated by adding\nLiveMigration\nto the list\n      of feature gates in the KubeVirt custom resource.\n>\nkubectl edit kubevirt kubevirt -n kubevirt\nspec:\n  configuration:\n    developerConfiguration:\n      featureGates:\n        - LiveMigration\n7.1\nPrerequisites\n#\nAll the Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) used by a VM must have\n            `ReadWriteMany` (RWX) access mode.\nVM pod network binding must be of type\nmasquerade\n:\nspec:\n  domain:\n    devices:\n      interfaces:\n        - name: green\n          masquerade: {}\nWhether live migration is possible or not can be checked via the\nVMI.status.conditions\nfield of a running VM spec:\n>\nkubectl describe vmi sles15sp2\nStatus:\n  Conditions:\n    Status: True\n    Type: LiveMigratable\n  Migration Method: BlockMigration\n7.2\nInitiating live migration\n#\nLive migration of a VMI can be initiated by applying the following yaml\n        file:\napiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1\nkind: VirtualMachineInstanceMigration\nmetadata:\n  name: migration-job\nspec:\n  vmiName: sles15sp2\n>\nkubectl apply -f migration-job.yaml\nAlternatively it is possible to migrate a VM using\nvirtctl\ntool:\n>\nvirtctl migrate VM\n7.3\nCancelling live migration\n#\nLive migration can be canceled by deleting the existing migration\n        object:\n>\nkubectl delete VirtualMachineInstanceMigration migration-job\n8\nVolume hotplugging\n#\nKubeVirt allows hotplugging additional storage into a running VM. Both\n      block and file system volume types are supported. The hotplug volumes\n      feature can be activated via the\nHotplugVolumes\nfeature gate:\n>\nkubectl edit kubevirt kubevirt -n kubevirt\nspec:\n  configuration:\n    developerConfiguration:\n      featureGates:\n        - HotplugVolumes\nAssuming that\nhp-volume\nis an existing DataVolume or\n      PVC,\nvirtctl\ncan be used to operate with the volume on\n      a runnig VM:\n>\nvirtctl addvolume sles15sp2 --volume-name=hp-volume\n>\nvirtctl removevolume sles15sp2 --volume-name=hp-volume\n9\nRunning Windows VMs with VMDP ISO\n#\nThe VMDP ISO is provided in the form of a container image which can be\n      consumed by KubeVirt. To run a Windows VM with VMDP ISO attached, the\n      corresponding\ncontainerDisk\nneeds to be added to the\n      VM definition:\nspec:\n  domain:\n    devices:\n      disks:\n        - name: vmdp\n          cdrom:\n            bus: sata\nvolumes:\n  - containerDisk:\n      image: registry.suse.com/suse/vmdp/vmdp:latest\n    name: vmdp\nNote\nThe sequence in which the disks are defined affects the boot order.

These technologies increase system security and are ideal for\n        multi-tenant environments such as cloud computing. They enable\n        protection from a variety of cross-VM and hypervisor-based attacks. As\n        an example, a hostile VM that has escaped its hypervisor-enforced\n        confines and is able to read arbitrary memory is unable to steal\n        sensitive data from an SEV or SEV-ES VM.\nThis document aims to provide a basic understanding of how SEV and\n        SEV-ES work, and how to enable and configure these features. It also\n        mentions certain limitations and restrictions that the use of SEV and\n        SEV-ES causes as compared to non-encrypted virtualization.\nRevision History: SUSE Linux Enterprise Server Documentation\n1\nIntroducing SEV\n#\nEncryption of computer data stored on disk is a widely-deployed feature.\n   However, data in RAM is stored in the clear. This can leave that data\n   vulnerable to software or hardware probing by intruders on the host system,\n   particularly in cloud computing environments where the physical resources\n   are shared by many tenants. Consider a virtual machine of a hostile tenant\n   escaping its sandbox because of a hypervisor bug and searching memory for\n   sensitive data.\nAMD's SEV (Secure Encrypted Virtualization) is a technology to protect Linux\n   KVM virtual machines by transparently encrypting the memory of each VM with\n   a unique key. SEV can also calculate a signature of the memory contents,\n   which can be sent to the VM's owner as an attestation that the memory was\n   encrypted correctly by the firmware. SEV is especially relevant to cloud\n   computing environments, where VMs are hosted on remote servers which are not\n   under the control of the VMs' owners. SEV can reduce the amount of trust VMs\n   need to place in the hypervisor and administrator of their host system.\nWhen a virtual machine is processing sensitive data, it can be present in\n   CPU registers as well as memory. If the processing is halted, for example,\n   to service an interrupt or share time with other processes, the virtual\n   machine's CPU register contents are saved to hypervisor memory. This memory\n   is readable by the hypervisor even if SEV is enabled. SEV-ES protects\n   against this scenario by encrypting all CPU register contents when the\n   processing of a virtual machine is halted. SEV-ES builds upon SEV to provide\n   an even smaller attack surface for virtual machines running in a\n   multi-tenant environment.\n2\nVM host requirements\n#\nThe VM host hardware must support AMD's SEV technology. To detect if the\n   host hardware supports SEV, check that the\nsev\nattribute is in the capabilities of\nlibvirt\nand that its\n   value is set appropriately:\n<domainCapabilities>\n   ...\n   <features>\n   ...\n   <sev supported='yes'/>\n   ...\n   </sev>\n   </features>\n</domainCapabilities>\nAdditionally, ensure that the\nkvm_amd\nkernel module has\n   the\nsev\nparameter enabled:\n/sys/module/kvm_amd/parameters/sev = 1\n3\nVM requirements\n#\nThe VM must be the modern\nQ35\nmachine type and must use\n   UEFI firmware.\nlibvirt\ncan automatically select an appropriate SEV or\n   SEV-ES enabled UEFI firmware, or one can be specified manually. Currently,\n   the only firmware supported are\n/usr/share/qemu/ovmf-x86_64-code.bin\nand\n/usr/share/qemu/ovmf-x86_64-4m-code.bin\n. See\nSection 6.3, “Installing UEFI support”\nfor more details on using UEFI\n   firmware and the auto-selection feature.\nNote: No IDE support in Q35\nThe Q35 machine type does not have an IDE controller and does not support\n    IDE disks.\nAll\nvirtio-net\ndevices need to be configured with the\n   iPXE option ROM disabled. iPXE is currently not compatible with SEV and\n   SEV-ES. In addition, all memory regions used by the VM must be locked for\n   Direct Memory Access (DMA) and to prevent swapping. This includes memory for\n   the VM and any memory regions allocated by QEMU to support running the VM,\n   such as UEFI pflash for firmware and variable store, video RAM, etc.\n4\nVM configuration\n#\nExample 1:\nSample configuration file\n#\nAs an example, an SEV-encrypted VM configured with 4 GB of memory would\n    contain the following XML configuration:\n<domain type='kvm'>\n    <memory unit='KiB'>4194304</memory>\n    <currentMemory unit='KiB'>4194304</currentMemory>\n    <memoryBacking>\n    <locked/>\n1\n</memoryBacking>\n    <os>\n    <type arch='x86_64' machine='pc-q35-2.11'>hvm</type>\n    <loader readonly='yes' type='pflash'>/usr/share/qemu/ovmf-x86_64-ms-4m-code.bin</loader>\n    <nvram>/var/lib/libvirt/qemu/nvram/sles15-sev-guest_VARS.fd</nvram>\n    <boot dev='hd'/>\n    </os>\n    <launchSecurity\n2\ntype='sev'>\n    <cbitpos>47</cbitpos>\n3\n<reducedPhysBits>1</reducedPhysBits>\n4\n<policy>0x0033</policy>\n5\n<dhCert>AAAABBBB=CCCCCDDDDD</dhCert>\n6\n<session>AAAABBBB=EEEEEFFFFF</session>\n7\n</launchSecurity>\n    <devices>\n    <interface type='bridge'>\n    <source bridge='br0'/>\n    <model type='virtio'/>\n    <rom enabled='no'/>\n8\n</interface>\n    ...\n    </devices>\n    ...\n    </domain>\n1\nThe\nmemoryBacking\nelement, along with its\n      child element\nlocking\n, is used to ease memory\n      limit restrictions libvirt places on the VM's cgroup. Otherwise, VM\n      creation would fail when QEMU attempts to lock the VM's memory regions\n      along with other regions used to support the VM operation. See\nhttps://libvirt.org/kbase/launch_security_sev.html#memory\nfor more information on VM memory configuration requirements for SEV VMs.\n2\nThe\nlaunchSecurity type='sev'\nelement and its\n      contents enable encryption of the VM's memory contents.\n3\nWhen memory encryption is enabled, one of the physical address bits (also\n      known as the \"C-bit\") is used to mark if a memory page is protected. The\n      required\ncbitpos\nelement provides the location\n      of the C-bit in a guest page table entry. For example, the value\n47\nindicates that bit position 47 in a page table\n      entry will determine whether that page is encrypted or not. The C-bit\n      number is read from the host's CPUID and is thus hardware-dependent. The\n      value of\ncbitpos\nis hypervisor-dependent, and\n      can be obtained through the\nsev\nelement in the\n      capabilities of the domain.\n4\nWhen memory encryption is enabled, we lose certain bits of the physical\n      address space. The required\nreducedPhysBits\nelement provides this physical address bit reduction. Similarly to\ncbitpos\n, the value of\nreducedPhysBits\nis processor-family-dependent\n      and can be obtained through the\nsev\nelement in\n      the domain capabilities.\n5\nThe required\npolicy\nelement provides the guest\n      policy which must be maintained by the SEV firmware. This policy is\n      enforced by the firmware, and restricts what configuration and\n      operational commands can be performed on the VM by the hypervisor. The\n      guest policy provided when starting the VM is bound to that VM and cannot\n      be changed throughout its lifetime.\n6\nThe optional\ndhCert\nelement provides the guest\n      owner's base64-encoded Diffie-Hellman (DH) key. The key is used to\n      negotiate a master secret key between the SEV firmware and guest owner.\n      This master secret key is then used to establish a trusted channel\n      between the SEV firmware and guest owner.\n7\nThe optional\nsession\nelement provides the\n      guest owner's base64-encoded session blob, as defined in the SEV API\n      specification. See the LAUNCH_START section of the SEV specification for\n      the session-blob format.\n8\nIn addition to the\nlaunchSecurity\nsettings,\n      SEV-encrypted VMs must have the iPXE option ROM disabled on all\n      virtio-net devices. Currently, iPXE is not compatible with SEV-encrypted\n      VMs.\nThe guest policy is four unsigned bytes with the following definition:\nTable 1:\nGuest policy definitions\n#\nBit(s)\nDefinition\n0\nIf set, debugging of the guest is disallowed\n1\nIf set, sharing keys with other guests is disallowed\n2\nIf set, SEV-ES is required\n3\nIf set, sending the guest to another platform is disallowed\n4\nIf set, the guest must not be transmitted to another platform that is\n        not in the domain\n5\nIf set, the guest must not be transmitted to another platform that is\n        not SEV-capable\n6-15\nReserved\n16-32\nThe guest must not be transmitted to another platform with a lower\n        firmware version\n5\nVM installation\n#\nvirt-install\nsupports the installation of SEV and SEV-ES\n   virtual machines. In addition to your standard installation parameters,\n   provide\nvirt-install\nwith options to satisfy the VM\n   requirements and the\n--launchSecurity\noption.\nThe following example starts a network installation of a SLES15 SP4 virtual\n   machine protected with SEV-ES.\nvirt-install --name sles15sp4-sev-es --location http://192.168.0.1/install/sles15sp4/x86_64 --disk size=20 --network=bridge=br0,model=virtio,rom.bar=off\n1\n--vcpus 4 --memory 4096 --noautoconsole --events on_reboot=destroy --machine q35 --memtune hard_limit=4563402 --launchSecurity sev,policy=0x07\n2\n--boot firmware=efi\n3\n--vnc --serial pty\n1\nThe iPXE option ROM is not compatible with SEV-encrypted VMs and must be\n     disabled on all virtio-net devices. While libvirt supports disabling\n     option ROMs using either the\nenabled\nor\nbar\nattributes of the\nrom\nelement, virt-install only supports disabling option ROMs using the\nbar\nattribute.\n2\nThe\nlaunchSecurity\noption specifies the type and policy\n     to be enforced by the SEV firmware. The policy setting is described in\nTable 1, “Guest policy definitions”\n.\n3\nThe\nboot\noption allows specifying many boot-related\n     settings, including the firmware used by the virtual machine. Specifying a\n     firmware type\nefi\nallows libvirt's firmware\n     auto-selection feature to select an appropriate SEV capable firmware for\n     the virtual machine.\n6\nSEV with KubeVirt\n#\nKubeVirt supports running SEV guests starting from the version\n0.49.0\n. The functionality can be activated by enabling\n   the\nWorkloadEncryptionSEV\nfeature gate:\n>\nkubectl edit kubevirt kubevirt -n kubevirt\n[...]\nspec:\n  configuration:\n    developerConfiguration:\n      featureGates:\n      - WorkloadEncryptionSEV\n[...]\nTo run an SEV-encrypted guest, the virtual machine specification must\n   include the entry\nsev: {}\nunder the\nlaunchSecurity\ndomain element. Additionally, you need to\n   configure the\nfirmware/bootloader\nparameters to use the\nefi\noption with the\nsecureBoot\nflag\n   set to\ndisabled\n. The corresponding YAML snippet will look\n   similar to the following:\n[...]\nspec:\n  domain:\n    firmware:\n      bootloader:\n        efi:\n          secureBoot: false\n    launchSecurity:\n      sev: {}\n[...]\n7\nCurrent limitations\n#\nSUSE does not recommend using the SEV and SEV-ES features with SUSE Linux\n   products on the first generation AMD EPYC™ 7000 series of processors, code\n   name Naples. It is recommended to use at least the second generation 7002\n   series processors, code name Rome. Additionally, the following limitations\n   are placed on SEV and SEV-ES VMs.\nThe guest operating system running inside an SEV-encrypted VM must contain\n     SEV support. SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP4 and newer, and all SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 releases support\n     SEV.\nAny operations that involve saving and restoring the memory and state of\n     an instance are currently not supported. This means that SEV-encrypted VMs\n     cannot be resumed from snapshots, saved/restored, or live migrated.\n     Encrypted VMs can be shutdown and restarted on another host as normal.\nSEV-encrypted VMs cannot contain directly-accessible host devices (that\n     is, PCI passthrough).\nSEV-encrypted VMs are not compatible with Secure Boot. UEFI firmware\n     containing Secure Boot support will not work with SEV or SEV-ES VMs.\nSEV-ES VMs cannot be rebooted from within using\nreboot\n,\nshutdown -r now\n, etc. A reboot must be done by shutting\n     down the VM and starting it again. This limitation does not apply to SEV\n     VMs, only SEV-ES.\nThese limitations will be removed in the future as the hardware, firmware,\n   and various layers of software receive new features.\n8\nMore information\n#\nhttps://developer.amd.com/sev\n— AMD-SEV landing\n     page\nhttps://www.amd.com/system/files/TechDocs/55766_SEV-KM_API_Specification.pdf\n— AMD SEV-KM API Specification (PDF)\nhttps://github.com/AMDESE/AMDSEV/\n— AMD SEV\n     GitHub repository containing examples and tools\nhttps://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#sev\n—\n     libvirt SEV configuration settings\nhttps://libvirt.org/kbase/launch_security_sev.html\n— libvirt knowledge base article on AMD SEV\n9\nGNU Free Documentation License\n#\nCopyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St,\n  Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

PREAMBLE\n#\nThe purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other\n  functional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure\n  everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without\n  modifying it, either commercially or non-commercially. Secondarily, this\n  License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their\n  work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by\n  others.\nThis License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of\n  the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the\n  GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free\n  software.\nWe have designed this License to use it for manuals for free software,\n  because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come\n  with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this\n  License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual\n  work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed\n  book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is\n  instruction or reference.\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n#\nThis License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that\n  contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed\n  under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide,\n  royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the\n  conditions stated herein. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or\n  work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You\n  accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way\n  requiring permission under copyright law.\nA \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document\n  or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or\n  translated into another language.\nA \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the\n  Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or\n  authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related\n  matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall\n  subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a\n  Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be\n  a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters,\n  or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position\n  regarding them.\nThe \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are\n  designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says\n  that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit\n  the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as\n  Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document\n  does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.\nThe \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as\n  Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the\n  Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5\n  words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\nA \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,\n  represented in a format whose specification is available to the general\n  public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with\n  generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint\n  programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is\n  suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a\n  variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an\n  otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has\n  been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is\n  not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any\n  substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called\n  \"Opaque\".\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII\n  without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a\n  publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or\n  PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats\n  include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can\n  be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which\n  the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the\n  machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors\n  for output purposes only.\nThe \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such\n  following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License\n  requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have\n  any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent\n  appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the\n  text.\nA section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title\n  either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that\n  translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section\n  name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\",\n  \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when\n  you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\"\n  according to this definition.\nThe Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states\n  that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are\n  considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards\n  disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers\n  may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.\n2. VERBATIM COPYING\n#\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially\n  or non-commercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and\n  the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced\n  in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of\n  this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the\n  reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you\n  may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large\n  enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may\n  publicly display copies.\n3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\n#\nIf you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed\n  covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license\n  notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that\n  carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the\n  front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also\n  clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front\n  cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally\n  prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.\n  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the\n  title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as\n  verbatim copying in other respects.\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you\n  should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual\n  cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more\n  than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along\n  with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a\n  computer-network location from which the general network-using public has\n  access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete\n  Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the\n  latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin\n  distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent\n  copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one\n  year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through\n  your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the\n  Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them\n  a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n4. MODIFICATIONS\n#\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the\n  conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified\n  Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the\n  role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the\n  Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do\n  these things in the Modified Version:\nUse in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from\n    that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if\n    there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may\n    use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that\n    version gives permission.\nList on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities\n    responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,\n    together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all\n    of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release\n    you from this requirement.\nState on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version,\n    as the publisher.\nPreserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\nAdd an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the\n    other copyright notices.\nInclude, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving\n    the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this\n    License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\nPreserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and\n    required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.\nInclude an unaltered copy of this License.\nPreserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it\n    an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the\n    Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section\n    Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year,\n    authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add\n    an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.\nPreserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public\n    access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network\n    locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on.\n    These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network\n    location for a work that was published at least four years before the\n    Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to\n    gives permission.\nFor any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the\n    Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and\n    tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given\n    therein.\nPreserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their\n    text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not\n    considered part of the section titles.\nDelete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be\n    included in the Modified Version.\nDo not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to\n    conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\nPreserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\nIf the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that\n  qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the\n  Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as\n  invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in\n  the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any\n  other section titles.\nYou may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing\n  but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example,\n  statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an\n  organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a\n  passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of\n  Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and\n  one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any\n  one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,\n  previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are\n  acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old\n  one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old\n  one.\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give\n  permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply\n  endorsement of any Modified Version.\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n#\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this\n  License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,\n  provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of\n  all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant\n  Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve\n  all their Warranty Disclaimers.\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple\n  identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are\n  multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make\n  the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in\n  parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if\n  known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section\n  titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the\n  combined work.\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the\n  various original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise\n  combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled\n  \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\".\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n#\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents\n  released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this\n  License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the\n  collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim\n  copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it\n  individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License\n  into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects\n  regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n#\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and\n  independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or\n  distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from\n  the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's\n  users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included\n  in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the\n  aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of\n  the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire\n  aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket\n  the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if\n  the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed\n  covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\n8. TRANSLATION\n#\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute\n  translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing\n  Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their\n  copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant\n  Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.\n  You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in\n  the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include\n  the original English version of this License and the original versions of\n  those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the\n  translation and the original version of this License or a notice or\n  disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\",\n  or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1)\n  will typically require changing the actual title.\n9. TERMINATION\n#\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as\n  expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify,\n  sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically\n  terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received\n  copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\n  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n#\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU\n  Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be\n  similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address\n  new problems or concerns. See\nhttps://www.gnu.org/copyleft/\n.\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the\n  Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \"or any\n  later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\n  conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has\n  been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the\n  Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose\n  any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.\nADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\n#\nCopyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME.\nPermission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document\nunder the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2\nor any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;\nwith no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.\nA copy of the license is included in the section entitled “GNU\nFree Documentation License”.\nIf you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,\n  replace the “with...Texts.” line with this:\nwith the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the\nFront-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\nIf you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination\n  of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.\nIf your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend\n  releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software\n  license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free\n  software.\nOn this page\n1\nIntroducing SEV\n2\nVM host requirements\n3\nVM requirements\n4\nVM configuration\n5\nVM installation\n6\nSEV with KubeVirt\n7\nCurrent limitations\n8\nMore information\n9\nGNU Free Documentation License\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

This article refers to the\n   Volta and Ampere GPU architecture.\n2\nConfiguring vGPU manager in VM Host Server\n#\n2.1\nPrepare VM Host Server environment\n#\nVerify that you have a compatible server and GPU cards. Check\n      specifications for details:\nhttps://docs.nvidia.com/grid/gpus-supported-by-vgpu.html\nhttps://docs.nvidia.com/grid/index.html\nVerify that VM Host Server is SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP3 or newer:\n>\ncat /etc/issue\nWelcome to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP3  (x86_64) - Kernel \\r (\\l).\nGet the vGPU drivers from NVIDIA. In order to get the software, please\n      follow the steps at\nhttps://docs.nvidia.com/grid/latest/grid-software-quick-start-guide/index.html#redeeming-pak-and-downloading-grid-software\n.\n      For example, for vGPU 13.0 installation, you will need the following\n      files:\nNVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-470.63-vgpu-kvm.run  # vGPU manager for the VM host\nNVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-470.63.01-grid.run   # vGPU driver for the VM guest\nIf you are using Ampere architecture GPU cards, verify that VM Host Server\n      supports VT-D/IOMMU and SR-IOV technologies, and that they are enabled in\n      BIOS.\nEnable IOMMU. Verify that it is included in the boot command line:\ncat /proc/cmdline\nBOOT_IMAGE=/boot/vmlinuz-default [...] intel_iommu=on [...]\nIf not, add the following line to\n/etc/default/grub\n.\nFor Intel CPUs:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"intel_iommu=on\"\nFor AMD CPUs:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"amd_iommu=on\"\nThen generate new GRUB 2 configuration file and reboot:\n>\nsudo\ngrub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl reboot\nTip\nYou can verify that IOMMU is loaded by running the following command:\nsudo dmesg | grep -e IOMMU\nEnable SR-IOV. Refer to\nhttps://docs.nvidia.com/grid/13.0/grid-vgpu-user-guide/index.html#vgpu-types-tesla-v100-pcie\nfor useful information.\nDisable the nouveau kernel module by adding the following line it to the\n      top of the\n/etc/modprobe.d/50-blacklist.conf\nfile:\nblacklist nouveau\n2.2\nInstall the NVIDIA KVM driver\n#\nExit from the graphical mode:\n>\nsudo\ninit 3\nInstall\nkernel-default-devel\nand\ngcc\npackages and their dependencies:\n>\nsudo\nzypper in kernel-default-devel gcc\nDownload the vGPU software from the NVIDIA portal. Make the NVIDIA\n      vGPU driver executable and run it:\n>\nchmod +x NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-450.55-vgpu-kvm.run\n>\nsudo\n./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-450.55-vgpu-kvm.run\nYou can find detailed information about the installation process in the\n      log file\n/var/log/nvidia-installer.log\nTip\nTo enable dynamic kernel-module support, and thus have the module\n       rebuilt automatically when a new kernel is installed, add the\n--dkms\noption:\n>\nsudo\n./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-450.55-vgpu-kvm.run --dkms\nWhen the driver installation is finished, reboot the system:\n>\nsudo\nsystemctl reboot\n2.3\nVerify the driver installation\n#\nVerify loaded kernel modules:\n>\nlsmod | grep nvidia\nnvidia_vgpu_vfio       49152  9\nnvidia              14393344  229 nvidia_vgpu_vfio\nmdev                   20480  2 vfio_mdev,nvidia_vgpu_vfio\nvfio                   32768  6 vfio_mdev,nvidia_vgpu_vfio,vfio_iommu_type1\nThe modules containing the\nvfio\nstring are required\n      dependencies.\nPrint the GPU device status with the\nnvidia-smi\ncommand. The output should be similar to the following one:\n>\nnvidia-smi\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| NVIDIA-SMI 470.63       Driver Version: 470.63       CUDA Version: N/A      |\n|-------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\n| GPU  Name        Persistence-M| Bus-Id        Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.

Refer to\nhttps://docs.nvidia.com/grid/latest/grid-vgpu-user-guide/index.html\nfor details.\n11\nNVIDIA virtual GPU background\n#\n11.1\nNVIDIA GPU architectures\n#\nThere are two types of GPU architectures:\nTime-sliced vGPU architecture\nIntroduced on GPUs that are based on the NVIDIA Ampere GPU\n       architecture. Only Ampere GPU cards can support MIG-backed vGPU.\nFigure 1:\nTime-sliced architecture (source:\nhttps://docs.nvidia.com/grid/latest/grid-vgpu-user-guide/index.html\n)\n#\nMulti-Instance GPU (MIG) vGPU architecture\nAll GPU cards support time-sliced vGPU. To do so, Ampere GPU cards use\n       the Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) mechanism, while Volta and\n       the earlier GPU cards use the mediated device mechanism. Volta and the\n       earlier architecture are based on mediated device mechanism. These two\n       mechanisms are transparent to a VM. However, they need different\n       configurations from the host side.\nFigure 2:\nMIG-backed architecture (source:\nhttps://docs.nvidia.com/grid/latest/grid-vgpu-user-guide/index.html\n)\n#\n11.2\nvGPU types\n#\nEach physical GPU can support several different types of vGPUs. vGPU types\n    have a fixed amount of frame buffer, the number of supported display heads,\n    and maximum resolutions. NVIDIA has four types of vGPUs: A, B, C, and\n    Q-series. SUSE currently supports Q and C-series.\nTable 1:\nvGPU types\n#\nvGPU series\nOptimal workload\nQ-series\nVirtual workstations for creative and technical professionals who\n         require the performance and features of the NVIDIA Quadro\n         technology.\nC-series\nCompute-intensive server workloads, for example, artificial\n         intelligence (AI), deep learning, or high-performance computing (HPC).\nB-series\nVirtual desktops for business professionals and knowledge workers.\nA-series\nApplication streaming or session-based solutions for virtual\n         applications users.\n11.3\nValid vGPU configurations on a single GPU\n#\n11.3.1\nTime-sliced vGPU configurations\n#\nFor time-sliced vGPUs, all vGPUs types must be the same:\nFigure 3:\nExample time-sliced vGPU configurations on NVIDIA Tesla M60 (source:\nhttps://docs.nvidia.com/grid/latest/grid-vgpu-user-guide/index.html\n)\n#\n11.3.2\nMIG-backed vGPU configurations\n#\nFor MIG-backed vGPUs, vGPUs can be both homogeneous and mixed-type:\nFigure 4:\nExample MIG-backed vGPU configurations on NVIDIA A100 PCIe 40GB (source:\nhttps://docs.nvidia.com/grid/latest/grid-vgpu-user-guide/index.html\n)\n#\n12\nGNU Free Documentation License\n#\nCopyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St,\n  Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA. Everyone is permitted to copy and\n  distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not\n  allowed.\n0. PREAMBLE\n#\nThe purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other\n  functional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure\n  everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without\n  modifying it, either commercially or non-commercially. Secondarily, this\n  License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their\n  work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by\n  others.\nThis License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of\n  the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the\n  GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free\n  software.\nWe have designed this License to use it for manuals for free software,\n  because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come\n  with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this\n  License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual\n  work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed\n  book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is\n  instruction or reference.\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n#\nThis License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that\n  contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed\n  under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide,\n  royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the\n  conditions stated herein. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or\n  work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You\n  accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way\n  requiring permission under copyright law.\nA \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document\n  or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or\n  translated into another language.\nA \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the\n  Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or\n  authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related\n  matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall\n  subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a\n  Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be\n  a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters,\n  or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position\n  regarding them.\nThe \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are\n  designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says\n  that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit\n  the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as\n  Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document\n  does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.\nThe \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as\n  Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the\n  Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5\n  words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\nA \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,\n  represented in a format whose specification is available to the general\n  public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with\n  generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint\n  programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is\n  suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a\n  variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an\n  otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has\n  been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is\n  not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any\n  substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called\n  \"Opaque\".\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII\n  without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a\n  publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or\n  PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats\n  include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can\n  be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which\n  the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the\n  machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors\n  for output purposes only.\nThe \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such\n  following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License\n  requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have\n  any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent\n  appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the\n  text.\nA section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title\n  either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that\n  translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section\n  name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\",\n  \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when\n  you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\"\n  according to this definition.\nThe Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states\n  that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are\n  considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards\n  disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers\n  may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.\n2. VERBATIM COPYING\n#\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially\n  or non-commercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and\n  the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced\n  in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of\n  this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the\n  reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you\n  may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large\n  enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may\n  publicly display copies.\n3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\n#\nIf you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed\n  covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license\n  notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that\n  carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the\n  front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also\n  clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front\n  cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally\n  prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.\n  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the\n  title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as\n  verbatim copying in other respects.\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you\n  should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual\n  cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more\n  than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along\n  with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a\n  computer-network location from which the general network-using public has\n  access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete\n  Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the\n  latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin\n  distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent\n  copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one\n  year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through\n  your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the\n  Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them\n  a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n4. MODIFICATIONS\n#\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the\n  conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified\n  Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the\n  role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the\n  Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do\n  these things in the Modified Version:\nUse in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from\n    that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if\n    there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may\n    use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that\n    version gives permission.\nList on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities\n    responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,\n    together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all\n    of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release\n    you from this requirement.\nState on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version,\n    as the publisher.\nPreserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\nAdd an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the\n    other copyright notices.\nInclude, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving\n    the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this\n    License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\nPreserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and\n    required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.\nInclude an unaltered copy of this License.\nPreserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it\n    an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the\n    Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section\n    Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year,\n    authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add\n    an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.\nPreserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public\n    access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network\n    locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on.\n    These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network\n    location for a work that was published at least four years before the\n    Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to\n    gives permission.\nFor any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the\n    Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and\n    tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given\n    therein.\nPreserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their\n    text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not\n    considered part of the section titles.\nDelete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be\n    included in the Modified Version.\nDo not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to\n    conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\nPreserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\nIf the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that\n  qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the\n  Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as\n  invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in\n  the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any\n  other section titles.\nYou may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing\n  but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example,\n  statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an\n  organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a\n  passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of\n  Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and\n  one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any\n  one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,\n  previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are\n  acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old\n  one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old\n  one.\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give\n  permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply\n  endorsement of any Modified Version.\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n#\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this\n  License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,\n  provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of\n  all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant\n  Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve\n  all their Warranty Disclaimers.\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple\n  identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are\n  multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make\n  the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in\n  parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if\n  known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section\n  titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the\n  combined work.\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the\n  various original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise\n  combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled\n  \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\".\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n#\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents\n  released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this\n  License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the\n  collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim\n  copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it\n  individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License\n  into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects\n  regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n#\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and\n  independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or\n  distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from\n  the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's\n  users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included\n  in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the\n  aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of\n  the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire\n  aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket\n  the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if\n  the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed\n  covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\n8. TRANSLATION\n#\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute\n  translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing\n  Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their\n  copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant\n  Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.\n  You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in\n  the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include\n  the original English version of this License and the original versions of\n  those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the\n  translation and the original version of this License or a notice or\n  disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\",\n  or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1)\n  will typically require changing the actual title.\n9. TERMINATION\n#\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as\n  expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify,\n  sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically\n  terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received\n  copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\n  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n#\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU\n  Free Documentation License from time to time.

First, a machine can obtain the time from\n    a server that is a reliable time source. Second, a machine can itself act\n    as a time source for other computers in the network. The goal is\n    twofold—maintaining the absolute time and synchronizing the system\n    time of all machines within a network.\nMaintaining an exact system time is important in many situations. The\n  built-in hardware clock does often not meet the requirements of applications\n  such as databases or clusters. Manual correction of the system time would\n  lead to severe problems because, for example, a backward leap can cause\n  malfunction of critical applications. Within a network, it is usually\n  necessary to synchronize the system time of all machines, but manual time\n  adjustment is a bad approach. NTP provides a mechanism to solve these\n  problems. The NTP service continuously adjusts the system time with reliable\n  time servers in the network. It further enables the management of local\n  reference clocks, such as radio-controlled clocks.\nSince\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n15,\nchrony\nis the default implementation of NTP.\nchrony\nincludes two parts;\nchronyd\nis a daemon that can be started at\n  boot time and\nchronyc\nis a command line interface program to monitor the\n  performance of\nchronyd\n, and to change various operating parameters at\n  runtime.\nStarting with\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n15.2, the YaST module for NTP client\n  configuration configures the systemd-timer instead of the cron daemon\n  to execute\nchrony\n, when it is not configured to run as a daemon.\n38.1\nConfiguring an NTP client with YaST\n#\nThe NTP daemon (\nchronyd\n) coming with the\nchrony\npackage is preset to use the local computer hardware clock as a time\n   reference. The precision of the hardware clock heavily depends on its time\n   source. For example, an atomic clock or GPS receiver is a very precise time\n   source, while a common RTC chip is not a reliable time source. YaST\n   simplifies the configuration of an NTP client.\nIn the YaST NTP client configuration (\nNetwork\n   Services\n›\nNTP Configuration\n)\n   window, you can specify when to start the NTP daemon, the type of the\n   configuration source, and add custom time servers.\nFigure 38.1:\nNTP configuration window\n#\n38.1.1\nNTP daemon start\n#\nYou can choose from three options for when to start the NTP daemon:\nOnly manually\nSelect\nOnly Manually\n, if you want to manually start\n       the\nchrony\ndaemon.\nSynchronize without daemon\nSelect\nSynchronize without Daemon\nto set the system\n       time periodically without a permanently running\nchrony\n. You can set\n       the\nInterval of the Synchronization in Minutes\n.\nNow and on boot\nSelect\nNow and On Boot\nto start\nchronyd\nautomatically when the system is booted. This setting is recommended.\n38.1.2\nType of the configuration source\n#\nIn the\nConfiguration Source\ndrop-down box, select\n    either\nDynamic\nor\nStatic\n. Set\nStatic\nif your server uses only a fixed set of (public)\n    NTP servers, while\nDynamic\nis better if your internal\n    network offers NTP servers via DHCP.\n38.1.3\nConfigure time servers\n#\nTime servers for the client to query are listed in the lower part of the\nNTP Configuration\nwindow. Modify this list as needed\n    with\nAdd\n,\nEdit\n, and\nDelete\n.\nClick\nAdd\nto add a new time server:\nFigure 38.2:\nAdding a time server\n#\nIn the\nAddress\nfield, type the URL of the time server\n      or pool of time servers with which you want to synchronize the machine\n      time. After the URL is complete, click\nTest\nto verify\n      that it points to a valid time source.\nActivate\nQuick Initial Sync\nto speed up the time\n      synchronization by sending more requests at the\nchronyd\ndaemon start.\nActivate\nStart Offline\nto speed up the boot time on\n      systems that start the\nchronyd\ndaemon automatically and may not have an\n      Internet connection at boot time. This option is useful, for example, for\n      laptops with network connections managed by NetworkManager.\nConfirm with\nOK\n.\n38.2\nManually configuring NTP in the network\n#\nchrony\nreads its configuration from the\n/etc/chrony.conf\nfile. To keep the computer clock\n   synchronized, you need to tell\nchrony\nwhat time servers to use. You can\n   use specific server names or IP addresses, for example:\n0.suse.pool.ntp.org\n1.suse.pool.ntp.org\n2.suse.pool.ntp.org\n3.suse.pool.ntp.org\nYou can also specify a\npool\nname. Pool name resolves to\n   several IP addresses:\npool pool.ntp.org\nTip: Computers on the same network\nTo synchronize time on multiple computers on the same network, we do not\n    recommend to synchronize all of them with an external server. A good\n    practice is to make one computer the time server which is synchronized with\n    an external time server, and the other computers act as its clients. Add a\nlocal\ndirective to the server's\n/etc/chrony.conf\nto distinguish it from an\n    authoritative time server:\nlocal stratum 10\nTo start\nchrony\n, run:\nsystemctl start chronyd.service\nAfter initializing\nchronyd\n, it takes some time before the time is\n   stabilized and the drift file for correcting the local computer clock is\n   created. With the drift file, the systematic error of the hardware clock can\n   be computed when the computer is powered on. The correction is used\n   immediately, resulting in a higher stability of the system time.\nTo enable the service so that\nchrony\nstarts automatically at boot time,\n   run:\nsystemctl enable chronyd.service\nWarning: Conflicting\nyast-timesync.service\nservice\nIn addition to the\nchronyd.service\nservice,\nSLES\nincludes\nyast-timesync.service\n.\nyast-timesync.service\nis triggered by a timer\n    every 5 minutes and runs\nchronyd\nwith the\n-q\noption to\n    set the system time and exit. Because only one instance of\nchronyd\ncan be\n    running at any given time, do not enable or start both\nchronyd\n-related\n    services at the same time.\n38.3\nConfigure\nchronyd\nat runtime using\nchronyc\n#\nYou can use\nchronyc\nto change the behavior of\nchronyd\nat runtime. It\n   also generates status reports about the operation of\nchronyd\n.\nYou can run\nchronyc\neither in interactive or non-interactive mode. To\n   run\nchronyc\ninteractively, enter\nchronyc\non the command line. It\n   displays a prompt and waits for your command input. For example, to check\n   how many NTP sources are online or offline, run:\n#\nchronyc\nchronyc> activity\n200 OK\n4 sources online\n2 sources offline\n1 sources doing burst (return to online)\n1 sources doing burst (return to offline)\n0 sources with unknown address\nTo exit\nchronyc\n's prompt, enter\nquit\nor\nexit\n.\nIf you do not need to use the interactive prompt, enter the command\n   directly:\n#\nchronyc\nactivity\nNote: Temporary changes\nChanges made using\nchronyc\nare not permanent. They will be lost after the\n    next\nchronyd\nrestart. For permanent changes, modify\n/etc/chrony.conf\n.\nFor a complete list of\nchronyc\ncommands, see its manual page (\nman\n   1 chronyc\n).\n38.4\nDynamic time synchronization at runtime\n#\nAlthough\nchronyd\nstarts up normally on a system that boots without a network\n  connection, the tool cannot resolve the DNS names of the time servers\n  specified in the configuration file.\nchronyd\nkeeps trying to resolve the time server names specified by the\nserver\n,\npool\n, and\npeer\ndirectives in an increasing time interval until it succeeds.\nIf the time server will not be reachable when\nchronyd\nis started, you can\n   specify the\noffline\noption:\nserver\nserver_address\noffline\nchronyd\nwill then not try to poll the server until it is enabled using the\n   following command:\n#\nchronyc online\nserver_address\nWhen the\nauto_offline\noption is set,\nchronyd\nassumes that\n   the time server has gone offline when two requests have been sent to it\n   without receiving a response. This option avoids the need to run the\n   'offline' command from\nchronyc\nwhen disconnecting the network link.\n38.5\nSetting up a local reference clock\n#\nThe software package\nchrony\nrelies on other programs (such as\ngpsd\n) to access the timing data via the SHM or SOCK\n   driver. Use the\nrefclock\ndirective in\n/etc/chrony.conf\nto specify a hardware reference clock\n   to be used as a time source. It has two mandatory parameters: a driver name\n   and a driver-specific parameter. The two parameters are followed by zero or\n   more\nrefclock\noptions.\nchronyd\nincludes the following\n   drivers:\nPPS - driver for the kernel 'pulse per second' API. For example:\nrefclock PPS /dev/pps0 lock NMEA refid GPS\nSHM - NTP shared memory driver. For example:\nrefclock SHM 0 poll 3 refid GPS1\nrefclock SHM 1:perm=0644 refid GPS2\nSOCK - Unix domain socket driver. For example:\nrefclock SOCK /var/run/chrony.ttyS0.sock\nPHC - PTP hardware clock driver. For example:\nrefclock PHC /dev/ptp0 poll 0 dpoll -2 offset -37\nrefclock PHC /dev/ptp1:nocrossts poll 3 pps\nFor more information on individual drivers' options, see\nman 8\n   chrony.conf\n.\n38.6\nClock synchronization to an external time reference (ETR)\n#\nSupport for clock synchronization to an external time reference (ETR) is\n   available. The external time reference sends an oscillator signal and a\n   synchronization signal every 2**20 (2 to the power of 20) microseconds to\n   keep TOD clocks of all connected servers synchronized.\nFor availability two ETR units can be connected to a machine. If the clock\n   deviates for more than the sync-check tolerance all CPUs get a machine check\n   that indicates that the clock is not synchronized. If this happens, all DASD I/O\n   to XRC enabled devices is stopped until the clock is synchronized again.\nThe ETR support is activated via two\nsysfs\nattributes;\n   run the following commands as\nroot\n:\necho 1 > /sys/devices/system/etr/etr0/online\necho 1 > /sys/devices/system/etr/etr1/online\nOn this page\n38.1\nConfiguring an NTP client with YaST\n38.2\nManually configuring NTP in the network\n38.3\nConfigure\nchronyd\nat runtime using\nchronyc\n38.4\nDynamic time synchronization at runtime\n38.5\nSetting up a local reference clock\n38.6\nClock synchronization to an external time reference (ETR)\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

First, a machine can obtain the time from\n    a server that is a reliable time source. Second, a machine can itself act\n    as a time source for other computers in the network. The goal is\n    twofold—maintaining the absolute time and synchronizing the system\n    time of all machines within a network.\nMaintaining an exact system time is important in many situations. The\n  built-in hardware clock does often not meet the requirements of applications\n  such as databases or clusters. Manual correction of the system time would\n  lead to severe problems because, for example, a backward leap can cause\n  malfunction of critical applications. Within a network, it is usually\n  necessary to synchronize the system time of all machines, but manual time\n  adjustment is a bad approach. NTP provides a mechanism to solve these\n  problems. The NTP service continuously adjusts the system time with reliable\n  time servers in the network. It further enables the management of local\n  reference clocks, such as radio-controlled clocks.\nSince\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n15,\nchrony\nis the default implementation of NTP.\nchrony\nincludes two parts;\nchronyd\nis a daemon that can be started at\n  boot time and\nchronyc\nis a command line interface program to monitor the\n  performance of\nchronyd\n, and to change various operating parameters at\n  runtime.\nStarting with\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n15.2, the YaST module for NTP client\n  configuration configures the systemd-timer instead of the cron daemon\n  to execute\nchrony\n, when it is not configured to run as a daemon.\n38.1\nConfiguring an NTP client with YaST\n#\nThe NTP daemon (\nchronyd\n) coming with the\nchrony\npackage is preset to use the local computer hardware clock as a time\n   reference. The precision of the hardware clock heavily depends on its time\n   source. For example, an atomic clock or GPS receiver is a very precise time\n   source, while a common RTC chip is not a reliable time source. YaST\n   simplifies the configuration of an NTP client.\nIn the YaST NTP client configuration (\nNetwork\n   Services\n›\nNTP Configuration\n)\n   window, you can specify when to start the NTP daemon, the type of the\n   configuration source, and add custom time servers.\nFigure 38.1:\nNTP configuration window\n#\n38.1.1\nNTP daemon start\n#\nYou can choose from three options for when to start the NTP daemon:\nOnly manually\nSelect\nOnly Manually\n, if you want to manually start\n       the\nchrony\ndaemon.\nSynchronize without daemon\nSelect\nSynchronize without Daemon\nto set the system\n       time periodically without a permanently running\nchrony\n. You can set\n       the\nInterval of the Synchronization in Minutes\n.\nNow and on boot\nSelect\nNow and On Boot\nto start\nchronyd\nautomatically when the system is booted. This setting is recommended.\n38.1.2\nType of the configuration source\n#\nIn the\nConfiguration Source\ndrop-down box, select\n    either\nDynamic\nor\nStatic\n. Set\nStatic\nif your server uses only a fixed set of (public)\n    NTP servers, while\nDynamic\nis better if your internal\n    network offers NTP servers via DHCP.\n38.1.3\nConfigure time servers\n#\nTime servers for the client to query are listed in the lower part of the\nNTP Configuration\nwindow. Modify this list as needed\n    with\nAdd\n,\nEdit\n, and\nDelete\n.\nClick\nAdd\nto add a new time server:\nFigure 38.2:\nAdding a time server\n#\nIn the\nAddress\nfield, type the URL of the time server\n      or pool of time servers with which you want to synchronize the machine\n      time. After the URL is complete, click\nTest\nto verify\n      that it points to a valid time source.\nActivate\nQuick Initial Sync\nto speed up the time\n      synchronization by sending more requests at the\nchronyd\ndaemon start.\nActivate\nStart Offline\nto speed up the boot time on\n      systems that start the\nchronyd\ndaemon automatically and may not have an\n      Internet connection at boot time. This option is useful, for example, for\n      laptops with network connections managed by NetworkManager.\nConfirm with\nOK\n.\n38.2\nManually configuring NTP in the network\n#\nchrony\nreads its configuration from the\n/etc/chrony.conf\nfile. To keep the computer clock\n   synchronized, you need to tell\nchrony\nwhat time servers to use. You can\n   use specific server names or IP addresses, for example:\n0.suse.pool.ntp.org\n1.suse.pool.ntp.org\n2.suse.pool.ntp.org\n3.suse.pool.ntp.org\nYou can also specify a\npool\nname. Pool name resolves to\n   several IP addresses:\npool pool.ntp.org\nTip: Computers on the same network\nTo synchronize time on multiple computers on the same network, we do not\n    recommend to synchronize all of them with an external server. A good\n    practice is to make one computer the time server which is synchronized with\n    an external time server, and the other computers act as its clients. Add a\nlocal\ndirective to the server's\n/etc/chrony.conf\nto distinguish it from an\n    authoritative time server:\nlocal stratum 10\nTo start\nchrony\n, run:\nsystemctl start chronyd.service\nAfter initializing\nchronyd\n, it takes some time before the time is\n   stabilized and the drift file for correcting the local computer clock is\n   created. With the drift file, the systematic error of the hardware clock can\n   be computed when the computer is powered on. The correction is used\n   immediately, resulting in a higher stability of the system time.\nTo enable the service so that\nchrony\nstarts automatically at boot time,\n   run:\nsystemctl enable chronyd.service\nWarning: Conflicting\nyast-timesync.service\nservice\nIn addition to the\nchronyd.service\nservice,\nSLES\nincludes\nyast-timesync.service\n.\nyast-timesync.service\nis triggered by a timer\n    every 5 minutes and runs\nchronyd\nwith the\n-q\noption to\n    set the system time and exit. Because only one instance of\nchronyd\ncan be\n    running at any given time, do not enable or start both\nchronyd\n-related\n    services at the same time.\n38.3\nConfigure\nchronyd\nat runtime using\nchronyc\n#\nYou can use\nchronyc\nto change the behavior of\nchronyd\nat runtime. It\n   also generates status reports about the operation of\nchronyd\n.\nYou can run\nchronyc\neither in interactive or non-interactive mode. To\n   run\nchronyc\ninteractively, enter\nchronyc\non the command line. It\n   displays a prompt and waits for your command input. For example, to check\n   how many NTP sources are online or offline, run:\n#\nchronyc\nchronyc> activity\n200 OK\n4 sources online\n2 sources offline\n1 sources doing burst (return to online)\n1 sources doing burst (return to offline)\n0 sources with unknown address\nTo exit\nchronyc\n's prompt, enter\nquit\nor\nexit\n.\nIf you do not need to use the interactive prompt, enter the command\n   directly:\n#\nchronyc\nactivity\nNote: Temporary changes\nChanges made using\nchronyc\nare not permanent. They will be lost after the\n    next\nchronyd\nrestart. For permanent changes, modify\n/etc/chrony.conf\n.\nFor a complete list of\nchronyc\ncommands, see its manual page (\nman\n   1 chronyc\n).\n38.4\nDynamic time synchronization at runtime\n#\nAlthough\nchronyd\nstarts up normally on a system that boots without a network\n  connection, the tool cannot resolve the DNS names of the time servers\n  specified in the configuration file.\nchronyd\nkeeps trying to resolve the time server names specified by the\nserver\n,\npool\n, and\npeer\ndirectives in an increasing time interval until it succeeds.\nIf the time server will not be reachable when\nchronyd\nis started, you can\n   specify the\noffline\noption:\nserver\nserver_address\noffline\nchronyd\nwill then not try to poll the server until it is enabled using the\n   following command:\n#\nchronyc online\nserver_address\nWhen the\nauto_offline\noption is set,\nchronyd\nassumes that\n   the time server has gone offline when two requests have been sent to it\n   without receiving a response. This option avoids the need to run the\n   'offline' command from\nchronyc\nwhen disconnecting the network link.\n38.5\nSetting up a local reference clock\n#\nThe software package\nchrony\nrelies on other programs (such as\ngpsd\n) to access the timing data via the SHM or SOCK\n   driver. Use the\nrefclock\ndirective in\n/etc/chrony.conf\nto specify a hardware reference clock\n   to be used as a time source. It has two mandatory parameters: a driver name\n   and a driver-specific parameter. The two parameters are followed by zero or\n   more\nrefclock\noptions.\nchronyd\nincludes the following\n   drivers:\nPPS - driver for the kernel 'pulse per second' API. For example:\nrefclock PPS /dev/pps0 lock NMEA refid GPS\nSHM - NTP shared memory driver. For example:\nrefclock SHM 0 poll 3 refid GPS1\nrefclock SHM 1:perm=0644 refid GPS2\nSOCK - Unix domain socket driver. For example:\nrefclock SOCK /var/run/chrony.ttyS0.sock\nPHC - PTP hardware clock driver. For example:\nrefclock PHC /dev/ptp0 poll 0 dpoll -2 offset -37\nrefclock PHC /dev/ptp1:nocrossts poll 3 pps\nFor more information on individual drivers' options, see\nman 8\n   chrony.conf\n.\n38.6\nClock synchronization to an external time reference (ETR)\n#\nSupport for clock synchronization to an external time reference (ETR) is\n   available. The external time reference sends an oscillator signal and a\n   synchronization signal every 2**20 (2 to the power of 20) microseconds to\n   keep TOD clocks of all connected servers synchronized.\nFor availability two ETR units can be connected to a machine. If the clock\n   deviates for more than the sync-check tolerance all CPUs get a machine check\n   that indicates that the clock is not synchronized. If this happens, all DASD I/O\n   to XRC enabled devices is stopped until the clock is synchronized again.\nThe ETR support is activated via two\nsysfs\nattributes;\n   run the following commands as\nroot\n:\necho 1 > /sys/devices/system/etr/etr0/online\necho 1 > /sys/devices/system/etr/etr1/online\nOn this page\n38.1\nConfiguring an NTP client with YaST\n38.2\nManually configuring NTP in the network\n38.3\nConfigure\nchronyd\nat runtime using\nchronyc\n38.4\nDynamic time synchronization at runtime\n38.5\nSetting up a local reference clock\n38.6\nClock synchronization to an external time reference (ETR)\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

It further enables the management of local\n  reference clocks, such as radio-controlled clocks.\nSince\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n15,\nchrony\nis the default implementation of NTP.\nchrony\nincludes two parts;\nchronyd\nis a daemon that can be started at\n  boot time and\nchronyc\nis a command line interface program to monitor the\n  performance of\nchronyd\n, and to change various operating parameters at\n  runtime.\nStarting with\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n15.2, the YaST module for NTP client\n  configuration configures the systemd-timer instead of the cron daemon\n  to execute\nchrony\n, when it is not configured to run as a daemon.\n38.1\nConfiguring an NTP client with YaST\n#\nThe NTP daemon (\nchronyd\n) coming with the\nchrony\npackage is preset to use the local computer hardware clock as a time\n   reference. The precision of the hardware clock heavily depends on its time\n   source. For example, an atomic clock or GPS receiver is a very precise time\n   source, while a common RTC chip is not a reliable time source. YaST\n   simplifies the configuration of an NTP client.\nIn the YaST NTP client configuration (\nNetwork\n   Services\n›\nNTP Configuration\n)\n   window, you can specify when to start the NTP daemon, the type of the\n   configuration source, and add custom time servers.\nFigure 38.1:\nNTP configuration window\n#\n38.1.1\nNTP daemon start\n#\nYou can choose from three options for when to start the NTP daemon:\nOnly manually\nSelect\nOnly Manually\n, if you want to manually start\n       the\nchrony\ndaemon.\nSynchronize without daemon\nSelect\nSynchronize without Daemon\nto set the system\n       time periodically without a permanently running\nchrony\n. You can set\n       the\nInterval of the Synchronization in Minutes\n.\nNow and on boot\nSelect\nNow and On Boot\nto start\nchronyd\nautomatically when the system is booted. This setting is recommended.\n38.1.2\nType of the configuration source\n#\nIn the\nConfiguration Source\ndrop-down box, select\n    either\nDynamic\nor\nStatic\n. Set\nStatic\nif your server uses only a fixed set of (public)\n    NTP servers, while\nDynamic\nis better if your internal\n    network offers NTP servers via DHCP.\n38.1.3\nConfigure time servers\n#\nTime servers for the client to query are listed in the lower part of the\nNTP Configuration\nwindow. Modify this list as needed\n    with\nAdd\n,\nEdit\n, and\nDelete\n.\nClick\nAdd\nto add a new time server:\nFigure 38.2:\nAdding a time server\n#\nIn the\nAddress\nfield, type the URL of the time server\n      or pool of time servers with which you want to synchronize the machine\n      time. After the URL is complete, click\nTest\nto verify\n      that it points to a valid time source.\nActivate\nQuick Initial Sync\nto speed up the time\n      synchronization by sending more requests at the\nchronyd\ndaemon start.\nActivate\nStart Offline\nto speed up the boot time on\n      systems that start the\nchronyd\ndaemon automatically and may not have an\n      Internet connection at boot time. This option is useful, for example, for\n      laptops with network connections managed by NetworkManager.\nConfirm with\nOK\n.\n38.2\nManually configuring NTP in the network\n#\nchrony\nreads its configuration from the\n/etc/chrony.conf\nfile. To keep the computer clock\n   synchronized, you need to tell\nchrony\nwhat time servers to use. You can\n   use specific server names or IP addresses, for example:\n0.suse.pool.ntp.org\n1.suse.pool.ntp.org\n2.suse.pool.ntp.org\n3.suse.pool.ntp.org\nYou can also specify a\npool\nname. Pool name resolves to\n   several IP addresses:\npool pool.ntp.org\nTip: Computers on the same network\nTo synchronize time on multiple computers on the same network, we do not\n    recommend to synchronize all of them with an external server. A good\n    practice is to make one computer the time server which is synchronized with\n    an external time server, and the other computers act as its clients. Add a\nlocal\ndirective to the server's\n/etc/chrony.conf\nto distinguish it from an\n    authoritative time server:\nlocal stratum 10\nTo start\nchrony\n, run:\nsystemctl start chronyd.service\nAfter initializing\nchronyd\n, it takes some time before the time is\n   stabilized and the drift file for correcting the local computer clock is\n   created. With the drift file, the systematic error of the hardware clock can\n   be computed when the computer is powered on. The correction is used\n   immediately, resulting in a higher stability of the system time.\nTo enable the service so that\nchrony\nstarts automatically at boot time,\n   run:\nsystemctl enable chronyd.service\nWarning: Conflicting\nyast-timesync.service\nservice\nIn addition to the\nchronyd.service\nservice,\nSLES\nincludes\nyast-timesync.service\n.\nyast-timesync.service\nis triggered by a timer\n    every 5 minutes and runs\nchronyd\nwith the\n-q\noption to\n    set the system time and exit. Because only one instance of\nchronyd\ncan be\n    running at any given time, do not enable or start both\nchronyd\n-related\n    services at the same time.\n38.3\nConfigure\nchronyd\nat runtime using\nchronyc\n#\nYou can use\nchronyc\nto change the behavior of\nchronyd\nat runtime. It\n   also generates status reports about the operation of\nchronyd\n.\nYou can run\nchronyc\neither in interactive or non-interactive mode. To\n   run\nchronyc\ninteractively, enter\nchronyc\non the command line. It\n   displays a prompt and waits for your command input. For example, to check\n   how many NTP sources are online or offline, run:\n#\nchronyc\nchronyc> activity\n200 OK\n4 sources online\n2 sources offline\n1 sources doing burst (return to online)\n1 sources doing burst (return to offline)\n0 sources with unknown address\nTo exit\nchronyc\n's prompt, enter\nquit\nor\nexit\n.\nIf you do not need to use the interactive prompt, enter the command\n   directly:\n#\nchronyc\nactivity\nNote: Temporary changes\nChanges made using\nchronyc\nare not permanent. They will be lost after the\n    next\nchronyd\nrestart. For permanent changes, modify\n/etc/chrony.conf\n.\nFor a complete list of\nchronyc\ncommands, see its manual page (\nman\n   1 chronyc\n).\n38.4\nDynamic time synchronization at runtime\n#\nAlthough\nchronyd\nstarts up normally on a system that boots without a network\n  connection, the tool cannot resolve the DNS names of the time servers\n  specified in the configuration file.\nchronyd\nkeeps trying to resolve the time server names specified by the\nserver\n,\npool\n, and\npeer\ndirectives in an increasing time interval until it succeeds.\nIf the time server will not be reachable when\nchronyd\nis started, you can\n   specify the\noffline\noption:\nserver\nserver_address\noffline\nchronyd\nwill then not try to poll the server until it is enabled using the\n   following command:\n#\nchronyc online\nserver_address\nWhen the\nauto_offline\noption is set,\nchronyd\nassumes that\n   the time server has gone offline when two requests have been sent to it\n   without receiving a response. This option avoids the need to run the\n   'offline' command from\nchronyc\nwhen disconnecting the network link.\n38.5\nSetting up a local reference clock\n#\nThe software package\nchrony\nrelies on other programs (such as\ngpsd\n) to access the timing data via the SHM or SOCK\n   driver. Use the\nrefclock\ndirective in\n/etc/chrony.conf\nto specify a hardware reference clock\n   to be used as a time source. It has two mandatory parameters: a driver name\n   and a driver-specific parameter. The two parameters are followed by zero or\n   more\nrefclock\noptions.\nchronyd\nincludes the following\n   drivers:\nPPS - driver for the kernel 'pulse per second' API. For example:\nrefclock PPS /dev/pps0 lock NMEA refid GPS\nSHM - NTP shared memory driver. For example:\nrefclock SHM 0 poll 3 refid GPS1\nrefclock SHM 1:perm=0644 refid GPS2\nSOCK - Unix domain socket driver. For example:\nrefclock SOCK /var/run/chrony.ttyS0.sock\nPHC - PTP hardware clock driver. For example:\nrefclock PHC /dev/ptp0 poll 0 dpoll -2 offset -37\nrefclock PHC /dev/ptp1:nocrossts poll 3 pps\nFor more information on individual drivers' options, see\nman 8\n   chrony.conf\n.\n38.6\nClock synchronization to an external time reference (ETR)\n#\nSupport for clock synchronization to an external time reference (ETR) is\n   available. The external time reference sends an oscillator signal and a\n   synchronization signal every 2**20 (2 to the power of 20) microseconds to\n   keep TOD clocks of all connected servers synchronized.\nFor availability two ETR units can be connected to a machine. If the clock\n   deviates for more than the sync-check tolerance all CPUs get a machine check\n   that indicates that the clock is not synchronized. If this happens, all DASD I/O\n   to XRC enabled devices is stopped until the clock is synchronized again.\nThe ETR support is activated via two\nsysfs\nattributes;\n   run the following commands as\nroot\n:\necho 1 > /sys/devices/system/etr/etr0/online\necho 1 > /sys/devices/system/etr/etr1/online\nOn this page\n38.1\nConfiguring an NTP client with YaST\n38.2\nManually configuring NTP in the network\n38.3\nConfigure\nchronyd\nat runtime using\nchronyc\n38.4\nDynamic time synchronization at runtime\n38.5\nSetting up a local reference clock\n38.6\nClock synchronization to an external time reference (ETR)\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

It further enables the management of local\n  reference clocks, such as radio-controlled clocks.\nSince\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n15,\nchrony\nis the default implementation of NTP.\nchrony\nincludes two parts;\nchronyd\nis a daemon that can be started at\n  boot time and\nchronyc\nis a command line interface program to monitor the\n  performance of\nchronyd\n, and to change various operating parameters at\n  runtime.\nStarting with\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n15.2, the YaST module for NTP client\n  configuration configures the systemd-timer instead of the cron daemon\n  to execute\nchrony\n, when it is not configured to run as a daemon.\n38.1\nConfiguring an NTP client with YaST\n#\nThe NTP daemon (\nchronyd\n) coming with the\nchrony\npackage is preset to use the local computer hardware clock as a time\n   reference. The precision of the hardware clock heavily depends on its time\n   source. For example, an atomic clock or GPS receiver is a very precise time\n   source, while a common RTC chip is not a reliable time source. YaST\n   simplifies the configuration of an NTP client.\nIn the YaST NTP client configuration (\nNetwork\n   Services\n›\nNTP Configuration\n)\n   window, you can specify when to start the NTP daemon, the type of the\n   configuration source, and add custom time servers.\nFigure 38.1:\nNTP configuration window\n#\n38.1.1\nNTP daemon start\n#\nYou can choose from three options for when to start the NTP daemon:\nOnly manually\nSelect\nOnly Manually\n, if you want to manually start\n       the\nchrony\ndaemon.\nSynchronize without daemon\nSelect\nSynchronize without Daemon\nto set the system\n       time periodically without a permanently running\nchrony\n. You can set\n       the\nInterval of the Synchronization in Minutes\n.\nNow and on boot\nSelect\nNow and On Boot\nto start\nchronyd\nautomatically when the system is booted. This setting is recommended.\n38.1.2\nType of the configuration source\n#\nIn the\nConfiguration Source\ndrop-down box, select\n    either\nDynamic\nor\nStatic\n. Set\nStatic\nif your server uses only a fixed set of (public)\n    NTP servers, while\nDynamic\nis better if your internal\n    network offers NTP servers via DHCP.\n38.1.3\nConfigure time servers\n#\nTime servers for the client to query are listed in the lower part of the\nNTP Configuration\nwindow. Modify this list as needed\n    with\nAdd\n,\nEdit\n, and\nDelete\n.\nClick\nAdd\nto add a new time server:\nFigure 38.2:\nAdding a time server\n#\nIn the\nAddress\nfield, type the URL of the time server\n      or pool of time servers with which you want to synchronize the machine\n      time. After the URL is complete, click\nTest\nto verify\n      that it points to a valid time source.\nActivate\nQuick Initial Sync\nto speed up the time\n      synchronization by sending more requests at the\nchronyd\ndaemon start.\nActivate\nStart Offline\nto speed up the boot time on\n      systems that start the\nchronyd\ndaemon automatically and may not have an\n      Internet connection at boot time. This option is useful, for example, for\n      laptops with network connections managed by NetworkManager.\nConfirm with\nOK\n.\n38.2\nManually configuring NTP in the network\n#\nchrony\nreads its configuration from the\n/etc/chrony.conf\nfile. To keep the computer clock\n   synchronized, you need to tell\nchrony\nwhat time servers to use. You can\n   use specific server names or IP addresses, for example:\n0.suse.pool.ntp.org\n1.suse.pool.ntp.org\n2.suse.pool.ntp.org\n3.suse.pool.ntp.org\nYou can also specify a\npool\nname. Pool name resolves to\n   several IP addresses:\npool pool.ntp.org\nTip: Computers on the same network\nTo synchronize time on multiple computers on the same network, we do not\n    recommend to synchronize all of them with an external server. A good\n    practice is to make one computer the time server which is synchronized with\n    an external time server, and the other computers act as its clients. Add a\nlocal\ndirective to the server's\n/etc/chrony.conf\nto distinguish it from an\n    authoritative time server:\nlocal stratum 10\nTo start\nchrony\n, run:\nsystemctl start chronyd.service\nAfter initializing\nchronyd\n, it takes some time before the time is\n   stabilized and the drift file for correcting the local computer clock is\n   created. With the drift file, the systematic error of the hardware clock can\n   be computed when the computer is powered on. The correction is used\n   immediately, resulting in a higher stability of the system time.\nTo enable the service so that\nchrony\nstarts automatically at boot time,\n   run:\nsystemctl enable chronyd.service\nWarning: Conflicting\nyast-timesync.service\nservice\nIn addition to the\nchronyd.service\nservice,\nSLES\nincludes\nyast-timesync.service\n.\nyast-timesync.service\nis triggered by a timer\n    every 5 minutes and runs\nchronyd\nwith the\n-q\noption to\n    set the system time and exit. Because only one instance of\nchronyd\ncan be\n    running at any given time, do not enable or start both\nchronyd\n-related\n    services at the same time.\n38.3\nConfigure\nchronyd\nat runtime using\nchronyc\n#\nYou can use\nchronyc\nto change the behavior of\nchronyd\nat runtime. It\n   also generates status reports about the operation of\nchronyd\n.\nYou can run\nchronyc\neither in interactive or non-interactive mode. To\n   run\nchronyc\ninteractively, enter\nchronyc\non the command line. It\n   displays a prompt and waits for your command input. For example, to check\n   how many NTP sources are online or offline, run:\n#\nchronyc\nchronyc> activity\n200 OK\n4 sources online\n2 sources offline\n1 sources doing burst (return to online)\n1 sources doing burst (return to offline)\n0 sources with unknown address\nTo exit\nchronyc\n's prompt, enter\nquit\nor\nexit\n.\nIf you do not need to use the interactive prompt, enter the command\n   directly:\n#\nchronyc\nactivity\nNote: Temporary changes\nChanges made using\nchronyc\nare not permanent. They will be lost after the\n    next\nchronyd\nrestart. For permanent changes, modify\n/etc/chrony.conf\n.\nFor a complete list of\nchronyc\ncommands, see its manual page (\nman\n   1 chronyc\n).\n38.4\nDynamic time synchronization at runtime\n#\nAlthough\nchronyd\nstarts up normally on a system that boots without a network\n  connection, the tool cannot resolve the DNS names of the time servers\n  specified in the configuration file.\nchronyd\nkeeps trying to resolve the time server names specified by the\nserver\n,\npool\n, and\npeer\ndirectives in an increasing time interval until it succeeds.\nIf the time server will not be reachable when\nchronyd\nis started, you can\n   specify the\noffline\noption:\nserver\nserver_address\noffline\nchronyd\nwill then not try to poll the server until it is enabled using the\n   following command:\n#\nchronyc online\nserver_address\nWhen the\nauto_offline\noption is set,\nchronyd\nassumes that\n   the time server has gone offline when two requests have been sent to it\n   without receiving a response. This option avoids the need to run the\n   'offline' command from\nchronyc\nwhen disconnecting the network link.\n38.5\nSetting up a local reference clock\n#\nThe software package\nchrony\nrelies on other programs (such as\ngpsd\n) to access the timing data via the SHM or SOCK\n   driver. Use the\nrefclock\ndirective in\n/etc/chrony.conf\nto specify a hardware reference clock\n   to be used as a time source. It has two mandatory parameters: a driver name\n   and a driver-specific parameter. The two parameters are followed by zero or\n   more\nrefclock\noptions.\nchronyd\nincludes the following\n   drivers:\nPPS - driver for the kernel 'pulse per second' API. For example:\nrefclock PPS /dev/pps0 lock NMEA refid GPS\nSHM - NTP shared memory driver. For example:\nrefclock SHM 0 poll 3 refid GPS1\nrefclock SHM 1:perm=0644 refid GPS2\nSOCK - Unix domain socket driver. For example:\nrefclock SOCK /var/run/chrony.ttyS0.sock\nPHC - PTP hardware clock driver. For example:\nrefclock PHC /dev/ptp0 poll 0 dpoll -2 offset -37\nrefclock PHC /dev/ptp1:nocrossts poll 3 pps\nFor more information on individual drivers' options, see\nman 8\n   chrony.conf\n.\n38.6\nClock synchronization to an external time reference (ETR)\n#\nSupport for clock synchronization to an external time reference (ETR) is\n   available. The external time reference sends an oscillator signal and a\n   synchronization signal every 2**20 (2 to the power of 20) microseconds to\n   keep TOD clocks of all connected servers synchronized.\nFor availability two ETR units can be connected to a machine. If the clock\n   deviates for more than the sync-check tolerance all CPUs get a machine check\n   that indicates that the clock is not synchronized. If this happens, all DASD I/O\n   to XRC enabled devices is stopped until the clock is synchronized again.\nThe ETR support is activated via two\nsysfs\nattributes;\n   run the following commands as\nroot\n:\necho 1 > /sys/devices/system/etr/etr0/online\necho 1 > /sys/devices/system/etr/etr1/online\nOn this page\n38.1\nConfiguring an NTP client with YaST\n38.2\nManually configuring NTP in the network\n38.3\nConfigure\nchronyd\nat runtime using\nchronyc\n38.4\nDynamic time synchronization at runtime\n38.5\nSetting up a local reference clock\n38.6\nClock synchronization to an external time reference (ETR)\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

First, a machine can obtain the time from\n    a server that is a reliable time source. Second, a machine can itself act\n    as a time source for other computers in the network. The goal is\n    twofold—maintaining the absolute time and synchronizing the system\n    time of all machines within a network.\nMaintaining an exact system time is important in many situations. The\n  built-in hardware clock does often not meet the requirements of applications\n  such as databases or clusters. Manual correction of the system time would\n  lead to severe problems because, for example, a backward leap can cause\n  malfunction of critical applications. Within a network, it is usually\n  necessary to synchronize the system time of all machines, but manual time\n  adjustment is a bad approach. NTP provides a mechanism to solve these\n  problems. The NTP service continuously adjusts the system time with reliable\n  time servers in the network. It further enables the management of local\n  reference clocks, such as radio-controlled clocks.\nSince\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n15,\nchrony\nis the default implementation of NTP.\nchrony\nincludes two parts;\nchronyd\nis a daemon that can be started at\n  boot time and\nchronyc\nis a command line interface program to monitor the\n  performance of\nchronyd\n, and to change various operating parameters at\n  runtime.\nStarting with\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n15.2, the YaST module for NTP client\n  configuration configures the systemd-timer instead of the cron daemon\n  to execute\nchrony\n, when it is not configured to run as a daemon.\n38.1\nConfiguring an NTP client with YaST\n#\nThe NTP daemon (\nchronyd\n) coming with the\nchrony\npackage is preset to use the local computer hardware clock as a time\n   reference. The precision of the hardware clock heavily depends on its time\n   source. For example, an atomic clock or GPS receiver is a very precise time\n   source, while a common RTC chip is not a reliable time source. YaST\n   simplifies the configuration of an NTP client.\nIn the YaST NTP client configuration (\nNetwork\n   Services\n›\nNTP Configuration\n)\n   window, you can specify when to start the NTP daemon, the type of the\n   configuration source, and add custom time servers.\nFigure 38.1:\nNTP configuration window\n#\n38.1.1\nNTP daemon start\n#\nYou can choose from three options for when to start the NTP daemon:\nOnly manually\nSelect\nOnly Manually\n, if you want to manually start\n       the\nchrony\ndaemon.\nSynchronize without daemon\nSelect\nSynchronize without Daemon\nto set the system\n       time periodically without a permanently running\nchrony\n. You can set\n       the\nInterval of the Synchronization in Minutes\n.\nNow and on boot\nSelect\nNow and On Boot\nto start\nchronyd\nautomatically when the system is booted. This setting is recommended.\n38.1.2\nType of the configuration source\n#\nIn the\nConfiguration Source\ndrop-down box, select\n    either\nDynamic\nor\nStatic\n. Set\nStatic\nif your server uses only a fixed set of (public)\n    NTP servers, while\nDynamic\nis better if your internal\n    network offers NTP servers via DHCP.\n38.1.3\nConfigure time servers\n#\nTime servers for the client to query are listed in the lower part of the\nNTP Configuration\nwindow. Modify this list as needed\n    with\nAdd\n,\nEdit\n, and\nDelete\n.\nClick\nAdd\nto add a new time server:\nFigure 38.2:\nAdding a time server\n#\nIn the\nAddress\nfield, type the URL of the time server\n      or pool of time servers with which you want to synchronize the machine\n      time. After the URL is complete, click\nTest\nto verify\n      that it points to a valid time source.\nActivate\nQuick Initial Sync\nto speed up the time\n      synchronization by sending more requests at the\nchronyd\ndaemon start.\nActivate\nStart Offline\nto speed up the boot time on\n      systems that start the\nchronyd\ndaemon automatically and may not have an\n      Internet connection at boot time. This option is useful, for example, for\n      laptops with network connections managed by NetworkManager.\nConfirm with\nOK\n.\n38.2\nManually configuring NTP in the network\n#\nchrony\nreads its configuration from the\n/etc/chrony.conf\nfile. To keep the computer clock\n   synchronized, you need to tell\nchrony\nwhat time servers to use. You can\n   use specific server names or IP addresses, for example:\n0.suse.pool.ntp.org\n1.suse.pool.ntp.org\n2.suse.pool.ntp.org\n3.suse.pool.ntp.org\nYou can also specify a\npool\nname. Pool name resolves to\n   several IP addresses:\npool pool.ntp.org\nTip: Computers on the same network\nTo synchronize time on multiple computers on the same network, we do not\n    recommend to synchronize all of them with an external server. A good\n    practice is to make one computer the time server which is synchronized with\n    an external time server, and the other computers act as its clients. Add a\nlocal\ndirective to the server's\n/etc/chrony.conf\nto distinguish it from an\n    authoritative time server:\nlocal stratum 10\nTo start\nchrony\n, run:\nsystemctl start chronyd.service\nAfter initializing\nchronyd\n, it takes some time before the time is\n   stabilized and the drift file for correcting the local computer clock is\n   created. With the drift file, the systematic error of the hardware clock can\n   be computed when the computer is powered on. The correction is used\n   immediately, resulting in a higher stability of the system time.\nTo enable the service so that\nchrony\nstarts automatically at boot time,\n   run:\nsystemctl enable chronyd.service\nWarning: Conflicting\nyast-timesync.service\nservice\nIn addition to the\nchronyd.service\nservice,\nSLES\nincludes\nyast-timesync.service\n.\nyast-timesync.service\nis triggered by a timer\n    every 5 minutes and runs\nchronyd\nwith the\n-q\noption to\n    set the system time and exit. Because only one instance of\nchronyd\ncan be\n    running at any given time, do not enable or start both\nchronyd\n-related\n    services at the same time.\n38.3\nConfigure\nchronyd\nat runtime using\nchronyc\n#\nYou can use\nchronyc\nto change the behavior of\nchronyd\nat runtime. It\n   also generates status reports about the operation of\nchronyd\n.\nYou can run\nchronyc\neither in interactive or non-interactive mode. To\n   run\nchronyc\ninteractively, enter\nchronyc\non the command line. It\n   displays a prompt and waits for your command input. For example, to check\n   how many NTP sources are online or offline, run:\n#\nchronyc\nchronyc> activity\n200 OK\n4 sources online\n2 sources offline\n1 sources doing burst (return to online)\n1 sources doing burst (return to offline)\n0 sources with unknown address\nTo exit\nchronyc\n's prompt, enter\nquit\nor\nexit\n.\nIf you do not need to use the interactive prompt, enter the command\n   directly:\n#\nchronyc\nactivity\nNote: Temporary changes\nChanges made using\nchronyc\nare not permanent. They will be lost after the\n    next\nchronyd\nrestart. For permanent changes, modify\n/etc/chrony.conf\n.\nFor a complete list of\nchronyc\ncommands, see its manual page (\nman\n   1 chronyc\n).\n38.4\nDynamic time synchronization at runtime\n#\nAlthough\nchronyd\nstarts up normally on a system that boots without a network\n  connection, the tool cannot resolve the DNS names of the time servers\n  specified in the configuration file.\nchronyd\nkeeps trying to resolve the time server names specified by the\nserver\n,\npool\n, and\npeer\ndirectives in an increasing time interval until it succeeds.\nIf the time server will not be reachable when\nchronyd\nis started, you can\n   specify the\noffline\noption:\nserver\nserver_address\noffline\nchronyd\nwill then not try to poll the server until it is enabled using the\n   following command:\n#\nchronyc online\nserver_address\nWhen the\nauto_offline\noption is set,\nchronyd\nassumes that\n   the time server has gone offline when two requests have been sent to it\n   without receiving a response. This option avoids the need to run the\n   'offline' command from\nchronyc\nwhen disconnecting the network link.\n38.5\nSetting up a local reference clock\n#\nThe software package\nchrony\nrelies on other programs (such as\ngpsd\n) to access the timing data via the SHM or SOCK\n   driver. Use the\nrefclock\ndirective in\n/etc/chrony.conf\nto specify a hardware reference clock\n   to be used as a time source. It has two mandatory parameters: a driver name\n   and a driver-specific parameter. The two parameters are followed by zero or\n   more\nrefclock\noptions.\nchronyd\nincludes the following\n   drivers:\nPPS - driver for the kernel 'pulse per second' API. For example:\nrefclock PPS /dev/pps0 lock NMEA refid GPS\nSHM - NTP shared memory driver.

First, a machine can obtain the time from\n    a server that is a reliable time source. Second, a machine can itself act\n    as a time source for other computers in the network. The goal is\n    twofold—maintaining the absolute time and synchronizing the system\n    time of all machines within a network.\nMaintaining an exact system time is important in many situations. The\n  built-in hardware clock does often not meet the requirements of applications\n  such as databases or clusters. Manual correction of the system time would\n  lead to severe problems because, for example, a backward leap can cause\n  malfunction of critical applications. Within a network, it is usually\n  necessary to synchronize the system time of all machines, but manual time\n  adjustment is a bad approach. NTP provides a mechanism to solve these\n  problems. The NTP service continuously adjusts the system time with reliable\n  time servers in the network. It further enables the management of local\n  reference clocks, such as radio-controlled clocks.\nSince\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n15,\nchrony\nis the default implementation of NTP.\nchrony\nincludes two parts;\nchronyd\nis a daemon that can be started at\n  boot time and\nchronyc\nis a command line interface program to monitor the\n  performance of\nchronyd\n, and to change various operating parameters at\n  runtime.\nStarting with\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n15.2, the YaST module for NTP client\n  configuration configures the systemd-timer instead of the cron daemon\n  to execute\nchrony\n, when it is not configured to run as a daemon.\n38.1\nConfiguring an NTP client with YaST\n#\nThe NTP daemon (\nchronyd\n) coming with the\nchrony\npackage is preset to use the local computer hardware clock as a time\n   reference. The precision of the hardware clock heavily depends on its time\n   source. For example, an atomic clock or GPS receiver is a very precise time\n   source, while a common RTC chip is not a reliable time source. YaST\n   simplifies the configuration of an NTP client.\nIn the YaST NTP client configuration (\nNetwork\n   Services\n›\nNTP Configuration\n)\n   window, you can specify when to start the NTP daemon, the type of the\n   configuration source, and add custom time servers.\nFigure 38.1:\nNTP configuration window\n#\n38.1.1\nNTP daemon start\n#\nYou can choose from three options for when to start the NTP daemon:\nOnly manually\nSelect\nOnly Manually\n, if you want to manually start\n       the\nchrony\ndaemon.\nSynchronize without daemon\nSelect\nSynchronize without Daemon\nto set the system\n       time periodically without a permanently running\nchrony\n. You can set\n       the\nInterval of the Synchronization in Minutes\n.\nNow and on boot\nSelect\nNow and On Boot\nto start\nchronyd\nautomatically when the system is booted. This setting is recommended.\n38.1.2\nType of the configuration source\n#\nIn the\nConfiguration Source\ndrop-down box, select\n    either\nDynamic\nor\nStatic\n. Set\nStatic\nif your server uses only a fixed set of (public)\n    NTP servers, while\nDynamic\nis better if your internal\n    network offers NTP servers via DHCP.\n38.1.3\nConfigure time servers\n#\nTime servers for the client to query are listed in the lower part of the\nNTP Configuration\nwindow. Modify this list as needed\n    with\nAdd\n,\nEdit\n, and\nDelete\n.\nClick\nAdd\nto add a new time server:\nFigure 38.2:\nAdding a time server\n#\nIn the\nAddress\nfield, type the URL of the time server\n      or pool of time servers with which you want to synchronize the machine\n      time. After the URL is complete, click\nTest\nto verify\n      that it points to a valid time source.\nActivate\nQuick Initial Sync\nto speed up the time\n      synchronization by sending more requests at the\nchronyd\ndaemon start.\nActivate\nStart Offline\nto speed up the boot time on\n      systems that start the\nchronyd\ndaemon automatically and may not have an\n      Internet connection at boot time. This option is useful, for example, for\n      laptops with network connections managed by NetworkManager.\nConfirm with\nOK\n.\n38.2\nManually configuring NTP in the network\n#\nchrony\nreads its configuration from the\n/etc/chrony.conf\nfile. To keep the computer clock\n   synchronized, you need to tell\nchrony\nwhat time servers to use. You can\n   use specific server names or IP addresses, for example:\n0.suse.pool.ntp.org\n1.suse.pool.ntp.org\n2.suse.pool.ntp.org\n3.suse.pool.ntp.org\nYou can also specify a\npool\nname. Pool name resolves to\n   several IP addresses:\npool pool.ntp.org\nTip: Computers on the same network\nTo synchronize time on multiple computers on the same network, we do not\n    recommend to synchronize all of them with an external server. A good\n    practice is to make one computer the time server which is synchronized with\n    an external time server, and the other computers act as its clients. Add a\nlocal\ndirective to the server's\n/etc/chrony.conf\nto distinguish it from an\n    authoritative time server:\nlocal stratum 10\nTo start\nchrony\n, run:\nsystemctl start chronyd.service\nAfter initializing\nchronyd\n, it takes some time before the time is\n   stabilized and the drift file for correcting the local computer clock is\n   created. With the drift file, the systematic error of the hardware clock can\n   be computed when the computer is powered on. The correction is used\n   immediately, resulting in a higher stability of the system time.\nTo enable the service so that\nchrony\nstarts automatically at boot time,\n   run:\nsystemctl enable chronyd.service\nWarning: Conflicting\nyast-timesync.service\nservice\nIn addition to the\nchronyd.service\nservice,\nSLES\nincludes\nyast-timesync.service\n.\nyast-timesync.service\nis triggered by a timer\n    every 5 minutes and runs\nchronyd\nwith the\n-q\noption to\n    set the system time and exit. Because only one instance of\nchronyd\ncan be\n    running at any given time, do not enable or start both\nchronyd\n-related\n    services at the same time.\n38.3\nConfigure\nchronyd\nat runtime using\nchronyc\n#\nYou can use\nchronyc\nto change the behavior of\nchronyd\nat runtime. It\n   also generates status reports about the operation of\nchronyd\n.\nYou can run\nchronyc\neither in interactive or non-interactive mode. To\n   run\nchronyc\ninteractively, enter\nchronyc\non the command line. It\n   displays a prompt and waits for your command input. For example, to check\n   how many NTP sources are online or offline, run:\n#\nchronyc\nchronyc> activity\n200 OK\n4 sources online\n2 sources offline\n1 sources doing burst (return to online)\n1 sources doing burst (return to offline)\n0 sources with unknown address\nTo exit\nchronyc\n's prompt, enter\nquit\nor\nexit\n.\nIf you do not need to use the interactive prompt, enter the command\n   directly:\n#\nchronyc\nactivity\nNote: Temporary changes\nChanges made using\nchronyc\nare not permanent. They will be lost after the\n    next\nchronyd\nrestart. For permanent changes, modify\n/etc/chrony.conf\n.\nFor a complete list of\nchronyc\ncommands, see its manual page (\nman\n   1 chronyc\n).\n38.4\nDynamic time synchronization at runtime\n#\nAlthough\nchronyd\nstarts up normally on a system that boots without a network\n  connection, the tool cannot resolve the DNS names of the time servers\n  specified in the configuration file.\nchronyd\nkeeps trying to resolve the time server names specified by the\nserver\n,\npool\n, and\npeer\ndirectives in an increasing time interval until it succeeds.\nIf the time server will not be reachable when\nchronyd\nis started, you can\n   specify the\noffline\noption:\nserver\nserver_address\noffline\nchronyd\nwill then not try to poll the server until it is enabled using the\n   following command:\n#\nchronyc online\nserver_address\nWhen the\nauto_offline\noption is set,\nchronyd\nassumes that\n   the time server has gone offline when two requests have been sent to it\n   without receiving a response. This option avoids the need to run the\n   'offline' command from\nchronyc\nwhen disconnecting the network link.\n38.5\nSetting up a local reference clock\n#\nThe software package\nchrony\nrelies on other programs (such as\ngpsd\n) to access the timing data via the SHM or SOCK\n   driver. Use the\nrefclock\ndirective in\n/etc/chrony.conf\nto specify a hardware reference clock\n   to be used as a time source. It has two mandatory parameters: a driver name\n   and a driver-specific parameter. The two parameters are followed by zero or\n   more\nrefclock\noptions.\nchronyd\nincludes the following\n   drivers:\nPPS - driver for the kernel 'pulse per second' API. For example:\nrefclock PPS /dev/pps0 lock NMEA refid GPS\nSHM - NTP shared memory driver. For example:\nrefclock SHM 0 poll 3 refid GPS1\nrefclock SHM 1:perm=0644 refid GPS2\nSOCK - Unix domain socket driver.

First, a machine can obtain the time from\n    a server that is a reliable time source. Second, a machine can itself act\n    as a time source for other computers in the network. The goal is\n    twofold—maintaining the absolute time and synchronizing the system\n    time of all machines within a network.\nMaintaining an exact system time is important in many situations. The\n  built-in hardware clock does often not meet the requirements of applications\n  such as databases or clusters. Manual correction of the system time would\n  lead to severe problems because, for example, a backward leap can cause\n  malfunction of critical applications. Within a network, it is usually\n  necessary to synchronize the system time of all machines, but manual time\n  adjustment is a bad approach. NTP provides a mechanism to solve these\n  problems. The NTP service continuously adjusts the system time with reliable\n  time servers in the network. It further enables the management of local\n  reference clocks, such as radio-controlled clocks.\nSince\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n15,\nchrony\nis the default implementation of NTP.\nchrony\nincludes two parts;\nchronyd\nis a daemon that can be started at\n  boot time and\nchronyc\nis a command line interface program to monitor the\n  performance of\nchronyd\n, and to change various operating parameters at\n  runtime.\nStarting with\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n15.2, the YaST module for NTP client\n  configuration configures the systemd-timer instead of the cron daemon\n  to execute\nchrony\n, when it is not configured to run as a daemon.\n38.1\nConfiguring an NTP client with YaST\n#\nThe NTP daemon (\nchronyd\n) coming with the\nchrony\npackage is preset to use the local computer hardware clock as a time\n   reference. The precision of the hardware clock heavily depends on its time\n   source. For example, an atomic clock or GPS receiver is a very precise time\n   source, while a common RTC chip is not a reliable time source. YaST\n   simplifies the configuration of an NTP client.\nIn the YaST NTP client configuration (\nNetwork\n   Services\n›\nNTP Configuration\n)\n   window, you can specify when to start the NTP daemon, the type of the\n   configuration source, and add custom time servers.\nFigure 38.1:\nNTP configuration window\n#\n38.1.1\nNTP daemon start\n#\nYou can choose from three options for when to start the NTP daemon:\nOnly manually\nSelect\nOnly Manually\n, if you want to manually start\n       the\nchrony\ndaemon.\nSynchronize without daemon\nSelect\nSynchronize without Daemon\nto set the system\n       time periodically without a permanently running\nchrony\n. You can set\n       the\nInterval of the Synchronization in Minutes\n.\nNow and on boot\nSelect\nNow and On Boot\nto start\nchronyd\nautomatically when the system is booted. This setting is recommended.\n38.1.2\nType of the configuration source\n#\nIn the\nConfiguration Source\ndrop-down box, select\n    either\nDynamic\nor\nStatic\n. Set\nStatic\nif your server uses only a fixed set of (public)\n    NTP servers, while\nDynamic\nis better if your internal\n    network offers NTP servers via DHCP.\n38.1.3\nConfigure time servers\n#\nTime servers for the client to query are listed in the lower part of the\nNTP Configuration\nwindow. Modify this list as needed\n    with\nAdd\n,\nEdit\n, and\nDelete\n.\nClick\nAdd\nto add a new time server:\nFigure 38.2:\nAdding a time server\n#\nIn the\nAddress\nfield, type the URL of the time server\n      or pool of time servers with which you want to synchronize the machine\n      time. After the URL is complete, click\nTest\nto verify\n      that it points to a valid time source.\nActivate\nQuick Initial Sync\nto speed up the time\n      synchronization by sending more requests at the\nchronyd\ndaemon start.\nActivate\nStart Offline\nto speed up the boot time on\n      systems that start the\nchronyd\ndaemon automatically and may not have an\n      Internet connection at boot time. This option is useful, for example, for\n      laptops with network connections managed by NetworkManager.\nConfirm with\nOK\n.\n38.2\nManually configuring NTP in the network\n#\nchrony\nreads its configuration from the\n/etc/chrony.conf\nfile. To keep the computer clock\n   synchronized, you need to tell\nchrony\nwhat time servers to use. You can\n   use specific server names or IP addresses, for example:\n0.suse.pool.ntp.org\n1.suse.pool.ntp.org\n2.suse.pool.ntp.org\n3.suse.pool.ntp.org\nYou can also specify a\npool\nname. Pool name resolves to\n   several IP addresses:\npool pool.ntp.org\nTip: Computers on the same network\nTo synchronize time on multiple computers on the same network, we do not\n    recommend to synchronize all of them with an external server. A good\n    practice is to make one computer the time server which is synchronized with\n    an external time server, and the other computers act as its clients. Add a\nlocal\ndirective to the server's\n/etc/chrony.conf\nto distinguish it from an\n    authoritative time server:\nlocal stratum 10\nTo start\nchrony\n, run:\nsystemctl start chronyd.service\nAfter initializing\nchronyd\n, it takes some time before the time is\n   stabilized and the drift file for correcting the local computer clock is\n   created. With the drift file, the systematic error of the hardware clock can\n   be computed when the computer is powered on. The correction is used\n   immediately, resulting in a higher stability of the system time.\nTo enable the service so that\nchrony\nstarts automatically at boot time,\n   run:\nsystemctl enable chronyd.service\nWarning: Conflicting\nyast-timesync.service\nservice\nIn addition to the\nchronyd.service\nservice,\nSLES\nincludes\nyast-timesync.service\n.\nyast-timesync.service\nis triggered by a timer\n    every 5 minutes and runs\nchronyd\nwith the\n-q\noption to\n    set the system time and exit. Because only one instance of\nchronyd\ncan be\n    running at any given time, do not enable or start both\nchronyd\n-related\n    services at the same time.\n38.3\nConfigure\nchronyd\nat runtime using\nchronyc\n#\nYou can use\nchronyc\nto change the behavior of\nchronyd\nat runtime. It\n   also generates status reports about the operation of\nchronyd\n.\nYou can run\nchronyc\neither in interactive or non-interactive mode. To\n   run\nchronyc\ninteractively, enter\nchronyc\non the command line. It\n   displays a prompt and waits for your command input. For example, to check\n   how many NTP sources are online or offline, run:\n#\nchronyc\nchronyc> activity\n200 OK\n4 sources online\n2 sources offline\n1 sources doing burst (return to online)\n1 sources doing burst (return to offline)\n0 sources with unknown address\nTo exit\nchronyc\n's prompt, enter\nquit\nor\nexit\n.\nIf you do not need to use the interactive prompt, enter the command\n   directly:\n#\nchronyc\nactivity\nNote: Temporary changes\nChanges made using\nchronyc\nare not permanent. They will be lost after the\n    next\nchronyd\nrestart. For permanent changes, modify\n/etc/chrony.conf\n.\nFor a complete list of\nchronyc\ncommands, see its manual page (\nman\n   1 chronyc\n).\n38.4\nDynamic time synchronization at runtime\n#\nAlthough\nchronyd\nstarts up normally on a system that boots without a network\n  connection, the tool cannot resolve the DNS names of the time servers\n  specified in the configuration file.\nchronyd\nkeeps trying to resolve the time server names specified by the\nserver\n,\npool\n, and\npeer\ndirectives in an increasing time interval until it succeeds.\nIf the time server will not be reachable when\nchronyd\nis started, you can\n   specify the\noffline\noption:\nserver\nserver_address\noffline\nchronyd\nwill then not try to poll the server until it is enabled using the\n   following command:\n#\nchronyc online\nserver_address\nWhen the\nauto_offline\noption is set,\nchronyd\nassumes that\n   the time server has gone offline when two requests have been sent to it\n   without receiving a response. This option avoids the need to run the\n   'offline' command from\nchronyc\nwhen disconnecting the network link.\n38.5\nSetting up a local reference clock\n#\nThe software package\nchrony\nrelies on other programs (such as\ngpsd\n) to access the timing data via the SHM or SOCK\n   driver. Use the\nrefclock\ndirective in\n/etc/chrony.conf\nto specify a hardware reference clock\n   to be used as a time source. It has two mandatory parameters: a driver name\n   and a driver-specific parameter. The two parameters are followed by zero or\n   more\nrefclock\noptions.\nchronyd\nincludes the following\n   drivers:\nPPS - driver for the kernel 'pulse per second' API. For example:\nrefclock PPS /dev/pps0 lock NMEA refid GPS\nSHM - NTP shared memory driver. For example:\nrefclock SHM 0 poll 3 refid GPS1\nrefclock SHM 1:perm=0644 refid GPS2\nSOCK - Unix domain socket driver.

First, a machine can obtain the time from\n    a server that is a reliable time source. Second, a machine can itself act\n    as a time source for other computers in the network. The goal is\n    twofold—maintaining the absolute time and synchronizing the system\n    time of all machines within a network.\nMaintaining an exact system time is important in many situations. The\n  built-in hardware clock does often not meet the requirements of applications\n  such as databases or clusters. Manual correction of the system time would\n  lead to severe problems because, for example, a backward leap can cause\n  malfunction of critical applications. Within a network, it is usually\n  necessary to synchronize the system time of all machines, but manual time\n  adjustment is a bad approach. NTP provides a mechanism to solve these\n  problems. The NTP service continuously adjusts the system time with reliable\n  time servers in the network. It further enables the management of local\n  reference clocks, such as radio-controlled clocks.\nSince\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n15,\nchrony\nis the default implementation of NTP.\nchrony\nincludes two parts;\nchronyd\nis a daemon that can be started at\n  boot time and\nchronyc\nis a command line interface program to monitor the\n  performance of\nchronyd\n, and to change various operating parameters at\n  runtime.\nStarting with\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server\n15.2, the YaST module for NTP client\n  configuration configures the systemd-timer instead of the cron daemon\n  to execute\nchrony\n, when it is not configured to run as a daemon.\n38.1\nConfiguring an NTP client with YaST\n#\nThe NTP daemon (\nchronyd\n) coming with the\nchrony\npackage is preset to use the local computer hardware clock as a time\n   reference. The precision of the hardware clock heavily depends on its time\n   source. For example, an atomic clock or GPS receiver is a very precise time\n   source, while a common RTC chip is not a reliable time source. YaST\n   simplifies the configuration of an NTP client.\nIn the YaST NTP client configuration (\nNetwork\n   Services\n›\nNTP Configuration\n)\n   window, you can specify when to start the NTP daemon, the type of the\n   configuration source, and add custom time servers.\nFigure 38.1:\nNTP configuration window\n#\n38.1.1\nNTP daemon start\n#\nYou can choose from three options for when to start the NTP daemon:\nOnly manually\nSelect\nOnly Manually\n, if you want to manually start\n       the\nchrony\ndaemon.\nSynchronize without daemon\nSelect\nSynchronize without Daemon\nto set the system\n       time periodically without a permanently running\nchrony\n. You can set\n       the\nInterval of the Synchronization in Minutes\n.\nNow and on boot\nSelect\nNow and On Boot\nto start\nchronyd\nautomatically when the system is booted. This setting is recommended.\n38.1.2\nType of the configuration source\n#\nIn the\nConfiguration Source\ndrop-down box, select\n    either\nDynamic\nor\nStatic\n. Set\nStatic\nif your server uses only a fixed set of (public)\n    NTP servers, while\nDynamic\nis better if your internal\n    network offers NTP servers via DHCP.\n38.1.3\nConfigure time servers\n#\nTime servers for the client to query are listed in the lower part of the\nNTP Configuration\nwindow. Modify this list as needed\n    with\nAdd\n,\nEdit\n, and\nDelete\n.\nClick\nAdd\nto add a new time server:\nFigure 38.2:\nAdding a time server\n#\nIn the\nAddress\nfield, type the URL of the time server\n      or pool of time servers with which you want to synchronize the machine\n      time. After the URL is complete, click\nTest\nto verify\n      that it points to a valid time source.\nActivate\nQuick Initial Sync\nto speed up the time\n      synchronization by sending more requests at the\nchronyd\ndaemon start.\nActivate\nStart Offline\nto speed up the boot time on\n      systems that start the\nchronyd\ndaemon automatically and may not have an\n      Internet connection at boot time. This option is useful, for example, for\n      laptops with network connections managed by NetworkManager.\nConfirm with\nOK\n.\n38.2\nManually configuring NTP in the network\n#\nchrony\nreads its configuration from the\n/etc/chrony.conf\nfile. To keep the computer clock\n   synchronized, you need to tell\nchrony\nwhat time servers to use. You can\n   use specific server names or IP addresses, for example:\n0.suse.pool.ntp.org\n1.suse.pool.ntp.org\n2.suse.pool.ntp.org\n3.suse.pool.ntp.org\nYou can also specify a\npool\nname. Pool name resolves to\n   several IP addresses:\npool pool.ntp.org\nTip: Computers on the same network\nTo synchronize time on multiple computers on the same network, we do not\n    recommend to synchronize all of them with an external server. A good\n    practice is to make one computer the time server which is synchronized with\n    an external time server, and the other computers act as its clients. Add a\nlocal\ndirective to the server's\n/etc/chrony.conf\nto distinguish it from an\n    authoritative time server:\nlocal stratum 10\nTo start\nchrony\n, run:\nsystemctl start chronyd.service\nAfter initializing\nchronyd\n, it takes some time before the time is\n   stabilized and the drift file for correcting the local computer clock is\n   created. With the drift file, the systematic error of the hardware clock can\n   be computed when the computer is powered on. The correction is used\n   immediately, resulting in a higher stability of the system time.\nTo enable the service so that\nchrony\nstarts automatically at boot time,\n   run:\nsystemctl enable chronyd.service\nWarning: Conflicting\nyast-timesync.service\nservice\nIn addition to the\nchronyd.service\nservice,\nSLES\nincludes\nyast-timesync.service\n.\nyast-timesync.service\nis triggered by a timer\n    every 5 minutes and runs\nchronyd\nwith the\n-q\noption to\n    set the system time and exit. Because only one instance of\nchronyd\ncan be\n    running at any given time, do not enable or start both\nchronyd\n-related\n    services at the same time.\n38.3\nConfigure\nchronyd\nat runtime using\nchronyc\n#\nYou can use\nchronyc\nto change the behavior of\nchronyd\nat runtime. It\n   also generates status reports about the operation of\nchronyd\n.\nYou can run\nchronyc\neither in interactive or non-interactive mode. To\n   run\nchronyc\ninteractively, enter\nchronyc\non the command line. It\n   displays a prompt and waits for your command input. For example, to check\n   how many NTP sources are online or offline, run:\n#\nchronyc\nchronyc> activity\n200 OK\n4 sources online\n2 sources offline\n1 sources doing burst (return to online)\n1 sources doing burst (return to offline)\n0 sources with unknown address\nTo exit\nchronyc\n's prompt, enter\nquit\nor\nexit\n.\nIf you do not need to use the interactive prompt, enter the command\n   directly:\n#\nchronyc\nactivity\nNote: Temporary changes\nChanges made using\nchronyc\nare not permanent. They will be lost after the\n    next\nchronyd\nrestart. For permanent changes, modify\n/etc/chrony.conf\n.\nFor a complete list of\nchronyc\ncommands, see its manual page (\nman\n   1 chronyc\n).\n38.4\nDynamic time synchronization at runtime\n#\nAlthough\nchronyd\nstarts up normally on a system that boots without a network\n  connection, the tool cannot resolve the DNS names of the time servers\n  specified in the configuration file.\nchronyd\nkeeps trying to resolve the time server names specified by the\nserver\n,\npool\n, and\npeer\ndirectives in an increasing time interval until it succeeds.\nIf the time server will not be reachable when\nchronyd\nis started, you can\n   specify the\noffline\noption:\nserver\nserver_address\noffline\nchronyd\nwill then not try to poll the server until it is enabled using the\n   following command:\n#\nchronyc online\nserver_address\nWhen the\nauto_offline\noption is set,\nchronyd\nassumes that\n   the time server has gone offline when two requests have been sent to it\n   without receiving a response. This option avoids the need to run the\n   'offline' command from\nchronyc\nwhen disconnecting the network link.\n38.5\nSetting up a local reference clock\n#\nThe software package\nchrony\nrelies on other programs (such as\ngpsd\n) to access the timing data via the SHM or SOCK\n   driver. Use the\nrefclock\ndirective in\n/etc/chrony.conf\nto specify a hardware reference clock\n   to be used as a time source. It has two mandatory parameters: a driver name\n   and a driver-specific parameter. The two parameters are followed by zero or\n   more\nrefclock\noptions.\nchronyd\nincludes the following\n   drivers:\nPPS - driver for the kernel 'pulse per second' API. For example:\nrefclock PPS /dev/pps0 lock NMEA refid GPS\nSHM - NTP shared memory driver. For example:\nrefclock SHM 0 poll 3 refid GPS1\nrefclock SHM 1:perm=0644 refid GPS2\nSOCK - Unix domain socket driver. For example:\nrefclock SOCK /var/run/chrony.ttyS0.sock\nPHC - PTP hardware clock driver. For example:\nrefclock PHC /dev/ptp0 poll 0 dpoll -2 offset -37\nrefclock PHC /dev/ptp1:nocrossts poll 3 pps\nFor more information on individual drivers' options, see\nman 8\n   chrony.conf\n.\n38.6\nClock synchronization to an external time reference (ETR)\n#\nSupport for clock synchronization to an external time reference (ETR) is\n   available. The external time reference sends an oscillator signal and a\n   synchronization signal every 2**20 (2 to the power of 20) microseconds to\n   keep TOD clocks of all connected servers synchronized.\nFor availability two ETR units can be connected to a machine. If the clock\n   deviates for more than the sync-check tolerance all CPUs get a machine check\n   that indicates that the clock is not synchronized. If this happens, all DASD I/O\n   to XRC enabled devices is stopped until the clock is synchronized again.\nThe ETR support is activated via two\nsysfs\nattributes;\n   run the following commands as\nroot\n:\necho 1 > /sys/devices/system/etr/etr0/online\necho 1 > /sys/devices/system/etr/etr1/online\nOn this page\n38.1\nConfiguring an NTP client with YaST\n38.2\nManually configuring NTP in the network\n38.3\nConfigure\nchronyd\nat runtime using\nchronyc\n38.4\nDynamic time synchronization at runtime\n38.5\nSetting up a local reference clock\n38.6\nClock synchronization to an external time reference (ETR)\nShare this page\n© SUSE\n                 2025"

Make sure your computer's clock is set to something\n\tsensible (within a few minutes of the 'true' time) - you could use\nntpdate\n\tpool.ntp.org\n, or you could just use the\ndate\ncommand and set it\n\tto your wristwatch. Start ntpd, and after some time (this could take as long as\n\thalf an hour!),\nntpq -pn\nshould output something like:\n$ ntpq -pn\n     remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset  jitter\n==============================================================================\n+81.6.42.224     193.5.216.14     2 u   68 1024  377  158.995   51.220  50.287\n*217.162.232.173 130.149.17.8     2 u  191 1024  176   79.245    3.589  27.454\n-129.132.57.95   131.188.3.222    3 u  766 1024  377   22.302   -2.928   0.508\nThe IP addresses will be different, because you've been assigned random\n\ttimeservers. The essential thing is that one of the lines starts with an\n\tasterisk (\n*\n), this means your computer gets the time from the Internet\n\t- you'll never have to worry about it again!\nLooking up\npool.ntp.org\n(or\n0.pool.ntp.org\n,\n1.pool.ntp.org\n, etc) will usually return IP addresses for servers\n\tin or close to your country. For most users this will give the best results.\nYou can also use the\ncontinental zones\n(For example\neurope\n,\nnorth-america\n,\noceania\nor\nasia\n.pool.ntp.org\n),\n\tand a country zone (like\nch.pool.ntp.org\nin Switzerland) - for all these zones, you can again use the 0,\n\t1, 2, or 3 prefixes, like\n0.ch.pool.ntp.org\n.  Note, however, that the country zone\n\tmight not exist for your country, or might contain only one or two timeservers.\nPlease also note that the system currently only provides IPv6 addresses for a zone in addition\n\tto IPv4 addresses if the zone name is prefixed by the number 2, e.g.\n2.pool.ntp.org\n(provided there are any IPv6 NTP servers in the respective zone). Zone names not prefixed by a\n\tnumber, or prefixed with any of 0, 1 or 3, currently provide IPv4 addresses only.\nIf you're using\na recent Windows version\n, you can use the ntp\n\tclient that is built into the system.\nRight click the data time in system area and select Adjust Date/time or open up settings with Win+I and click Time & Language -> Date & Time.\n\t\tscroll down and click Date, time, regional formatting\n\t\tscroll down and click Additional date, time & regional settings\n\t\tclick Date and Time and Internet Time\n\t\tclick the Change settings button.

If business, organization or human life\n        depends on having correct time or can be harmed by it being\n        wrong, you shouldn't \"just get it off the Internet\". The NTP\n        Pool is generally very high quality, but it is a service run\n        by volunteers in their spare time. Please talk to your\n        equipment and service vendors about getting local and reliable\n        service setup for you. See also our\nterms\n        of service\n.\n\n        We recommend time servers from\nMeinberg\n,\n        but you can also find time servers from\nEnd Run\n,\nSpectracom\nand many others.\nIf you have a static IP address and a reasonable Internet connection\n(bandwidth\n\tis not so important, but it should be stable and not too highly loaded), please\n\tconsider donating your server to the server pool. It doesn't cost you more than\n\ta few hundred bytes per second traffic, but you help this project survive.\n\tPlease\nread the joining page\nfor more information.\nIf your Internet provider has a timeserver\n, or if you know of a good timeserver\n\tnear you, you should use that and not this list - you'll probably get better\n\ttime and you'll use fewer network resources.  If you know only one timeserver\n\tnear you, you can of course use that and two from pool.ntp.org or so.\nIt can rarely happen that you are assigned the same timeserver twice\n-\n\tjust restarting the ntp server usually solves this problem.  If you\n\tuse a country zone, please note that it may be because there is only\n\tone server known in the project - better use a continental zone in\n\tthat case.  You can\nbrowse the zones\nto see how\n\tmany servers we have in each zone.\nBe friendly\n. Many servers are provided by volunteers, and almost all time\n\tservers are really file or mail or webservers which just happen to also run ntp.\n\tSo don't use more than four time servers in your configuration, and don't play\n\ttricks with\nburst\nor\nminpoll\n- all you will gain is extra\n        load on the volunteer time servers.\nMake sure that the\ntime zone configuration\nof your computer is correct\n.\n\tntpd itself does not do anything about the time zones, it just uses UTC\n\tinternally.\nIf you are synchronising a network to pool.ntp.org\n, please set up one of your\n\tcomputers as a time server and synchronize the other computers to that one.\n\t(you'll have some reading to do - it's not difficult though. And there's always\n\tthe\ncomp.protocols.time.ntp newsgroup\n.)\nAt this point, I'd like to thank those donating their time and timeservers to\n\tthis network.\nStatus\n|\nCommunity"

Usage of the pool has grown\n\tenormously, and the only way we can keep it easy for everyone to run a\n\tpool server is to also grow the number of servers participating.\nYour computer\nmust have a static IP address\nand a permanent\n\tInternet connection.  It's very important that your IP address doesn't\n\tchange or only does so extremely infrequently (say once a year or\n\tless).  The required bandwidth is relatively low.  Each client will\n\tonly send a few UDP packets every few to every 20 minutes.\nCurrently most servers get about 5-15 NTP packets per second\n\twith spikes of 60-120 packets per second a few times a day.\n\tThis is roughly equivalent to 10-15Kbit/sec with\n\tspikes of 50-120Kbit/sec.  The project steadily acquires more\n\ttimeservers, so the load should not increase dramatically for\n\teach server.  In plain terms, you probably need at least\n\t384-512Kbit bandwidth (in and out-going).\nThe servers joining should not have\npool.ntp.org\nas their upstream\n\tserver(s), but should configure some\ngood servers\nmanually. Those servers\nmay\nbe chosen from the pool. The point is that they are chosen\n\tstatically instead of being assigned randomly from the pool at each server\n\trestart.  This will help providing an acceptable quality of service.\n\n\tNote that it is not required that your server is a stratum 1 or 2\n\tserver - as this project is about load distribution mostly, there is\n\tno reason why a stratum 3 or even stratum 4 server shouldn't join.\nWe have a page with\nconfiguration recommendations for servers joining the pool\n.\nFinally, I must emphasize that joining the pool is a\nlong term\n\tcommitment\n.  We are happy to take you out of the pool again if your\n\tcircumstances change, but because of how the NTP clients operate\nit\n\twill take weeks, months or even YEARS before the traffic completely\n    goes away\n.\nIf this is all ok, login to the\nserver management\npage and request your server to be added.\n\tIf you have any trouble with the system, email me at\nask@develooper.com\n.\nPlease also join the\ncommunity forum\nIt would be nice (but it's not necessary) if you could redirect web requests\n\ton port 80 of your time server to the official web page of the project at\nhttps://www.ntppool.org/\n. If you run Apache, you could do this with:\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n       ServerName pool.ntp.org\n       ServerAlias *.pool.ntp.org *.ntppool.org\n       Redirect permanent / https://www.ntppool.org/\n    </VirtualHost>\nAgain, this is only if you run a webserver anyway. The official project web\n\tpage will always be given with the 'www' at the beginning - but sometimes\n\tpeople type\npool.ntp.org\nand are then surprised to get a random web\n        page.\nOnce added to the pool the server is constantly monitored for\n        availability and precision.  You can watch your server's\n        performance using the\nweb frontend\nor\n        the\nmanagement page\n.\nStatus\n|\nCommunity"

If you have communicating programs running on different computers, time still should even advance if you switch from one computer to another. Obviously if one system is ahead of the others, the others are behind that particular one. From the perspective of an external observer, switching between these systems would cause time to jump forward and back, a non-desirable effect.\nAs a consequence, isolated networks may run their own wrong time, but as soon as you connect to the Internet, effects will be visible. Just imagine some EMail message arrived five minutes before it was sent, and there even was a reply two minutes before the message was sent.\nEven on a single computer some applications have trouble when the time jumps backwards. For example, database systems using transactions and crash recovery like to know the time of the last good state.\nTherefore, air traffic control was one of the first applications for NTP.\nBasic guidelines\nNTP is a service typically running quietly in the background. When servers are chosen they will typically remain in the\n\tconfiguration \"forever\". If the client traffic causes trouble for the server it is extremely difficult to mitigate if not carefully\n\tplanned for in advance.\nA couple of examples in the past years are\nFlawed Routers Flood University of Wisconsin Internet Time Server\nin 2003 and the\nD-Link misconfiguration incident\nin 2006.\nYou must get approval from the server operator before you\n\thardcode any IP addresses or hostnames. This is easy to get if your own\n\torganization runs the NTP servers you are planning to use. In most other cases\n\tyou will not get it.\nDo not use the standard\npool.ntp.org\nnames as a default configuration in your system. The NTP Pool can offer services for\n\tyou, but it must be setup in advance (see below).\nTypically the best solution is for your organization to setup your own cluster of NTP servers, for example ntp1.example.com, ntp2.example.com and ntp3.example.com and use those as the default in your configuration.\nWhat the NTP Pool can offer\nThe NTP Pool Project was started in 2003 as a response to the rapidly increasing resource consumption\n\tat the popular NTP servers and the problem of these servers then closing their operations.  Today it has grown to be central to the operation of millions of systems around the world.\nRather than establish and maintain your own cluster of NTP servers or negotiate with individual server operators to use their server, you can use the NTP Pool.\nGet your vendor zone\nTo allow you to use the pool as the default time service in your\n\tapplication, we will set you up with special hostnames, for example\n0.vendor.pool.ntp.org\n,\n1.vendor.pool.ntp.org\n,\n2.vendor.pool.ntp.org\nand\n3.vendor.pool.ntp.org\n.\nYou\nmust absolutely not use the default pool.ntp.org zone names\nas the default configuration in your application or appliance.\nYou can\napply for a vendor zone\nhere on the site.\nIf you have an open source ntpd implementation or an operating system\n\tincluding ntpd, we ask that you make a reference in the configuration\n\tfile or documentation encouraging people to\njoin\n\tthe pool\n.\nIf you are a commercial / closed-source vendor we will ask for a\nsmall contribution\nto help scaling\n\tthe pool to meet demands.\nQuestions?  Email\nask@develooper.com\n.\nPool Capacity\nThe pool is currently keeping the time of an estimated 5-15 million systems accurate.\nWith our technology and expertise we can vastly expand the number of supported systems with relatively modest contributions.\nImplementation specifics\nYou can choose either to implement a full ntpd server or a simpler SNTP implementation.\n\n\t\tA few more pointers and ground-rules:\nOnly use the pool.ntp.org hostnames designated to you (typically {0,1,2,3}.{vendor}.pool.ntp.org)\nDo implement handling of the \"KoD\" response\nDon't send excessively frequent queries.  Reasonable query intervals are typically from once or twice a day to a 4-5 times an hour depending on the application.  Really consider how often the device will need \"fresh time\".  A standard ntpd or openntpd server works, too.\nDo have your devices query the NTP servers at random times of the day.  For example every 43200 seconds since boot is good, at midnight every day is bad.\nDo re-query DNS for a new NTP server IP address if one of the current NTP servers stops responding, though not more often than once per hour.\nRead the\nnew SNTP RFC\nif you are implementing an SNTP client.\nWe can refer you to consultants with vast expertise in the NTP protocol and time-keeping applications who can help.  Just email Ask Bjørn Hansen at\nask@develooper.com\n.\nOpen source projects\nOpen Source projects are of course particularly welcome to use the pool in their default setup, but we ask that you\nget a vendor zone\nwhen using the pool as a default configuration.\nVendor FAQ\nMost questions should be answered elsewhere on the page.  Here are some that didn't fit in above.\nWhy use special hostnames for vendors?\nThe special hostnames allows us some control of the traffic so we\n\tcan optimize our load distribution and match clients to the best\n\tservers.  It also gives better options for continuing support in case\n\tof problems with segments of the client population.  (See the links in\n\tthe\nbasic guidelines\nsection).\nStatus\n|\nCommunity"

If we could, we’d be able to move the physical servers the following Sunday without downtime to any critical services, and get us closer to having proper redundancy.\nWorking with the Packet system has been fascinating and extremely productive.

If you have communicating programs running on different computers, time still should even advance if you switch from one computer to another. Obviously if one system is ahead of the others, the others are behind that particular one. From the perspective of an external observer, switching between these systems would cause time to jump forward and back, a non-desirable effect.\nAs a consequence, isolated networks may run their own wrong time, but as soon as you connect to the Internet, effects will be visible. Just imagine some EMail message arrived five minutes before it was sent, and there even was a reply two minutes before the message was sent.\nEven on a single computer some applications have trouble when the time jumps backwards. For example, database systems using transactions and crash recovery like to know the time of the last good state.\nTherefore, air traffic control was one of the first applications for NTP.\nBasic guidelines\nNTP is a service typically running quietly in the background. When servers are chosen they will typically remain in the\n\tconfiguration \"forever\". If the client traffic causes trouble for the server it is extremely difficult to mitigate if not carefully\n\tplanned for in advance.\nA couple of examples in the past years are\nFlawed Routers Flood University of Wisconsin Internet Time Server\nin 2003 and the\nD-Link misconfiguration incident\nin 2006.\nYou must get approval from the server operator before you\n\thardcode any IP addresses or hostnames. This is easy to get if your own\n\torganization runs the NTP servers you are planning to use. In most other cases\n\tyou will not get it.\nDo not use the standard\npool.ntp.org\nnames as a default configuration in your system. The NTP Pool can offer services for\n\tyou, but it must be setup in advance (see below).\nTypically the best solution is for your organization to setup your own cluster of NTP servers, for example ntp1.example.com, ntp2.example.com and ntp3.example.com and use those as the default in your configuration.\nWhat the NTP Pool can offer\nThe NTP Pool Project was started in 2003 as a response to the rapidly increasing resource consumption\n\tat the popular NTP servers and the problem of these servers then closing their operations.  Today it has grown to be central to the operation of millions of systems around the world.\nRather than establish and maintain your own cluster of NTP servers or negotiate with individual server operators to use their server, you can use the NTP Pool.\nGet your vendor zone\nTo allow you to use the pool as the default time service in your\n\tapplication, we will set you up with special hostnames, for example\n0.vendor.pool.ntp.org\n,\n1.vendor.pool.ntp.org\n,\n2.vendor.pool.ntp.org\nand\n3.vendor.pool.ntp.org\n.\nYou\nmust absolutely not use the default pool.ntp.org zone names\nas the default configuration in your application or appliance.\nYou can\napply for a vendor zone\nhere on the site.\nIf you have an open source ntpd implementation or an operating system\n\tincluding ntpd, we ask that you make a reference in the configuration\n\tfile or documentation encouraging people to\njoin\n\tthe pool\n.\nIf you are a commercial / closed-source vendor we will ask for a\nsmall contribution\nto help scaling\n\tthe pool to meet demands.\nQuestions?  Email\nask@develooper.com\n.\nPool Capacity\nThe pool is currently keeping the time of an estimated 5-15 million systems accurate.\nWith our technology and expertise we can vastly expand the number of supported systems with relatively modest contributions.\nImplementation specifics\nYou can choose either to implement a full ntpd server or a simpler SNTP implementation.\n\n\t\tA few more pointers and ground-rules:\nOnly use the pool.ntp.org hostnames designated to you (typically {0,1,2,3}.{vendor}.pool.ntp.org)\nDo implement handling of the \"KoD\" response\nDon't send excessively frequent queries.  Reasonable query intervals are typically from once or twice a day to a 4-5 times an hour depending on the application.  Really consider how often the device will need \"fresh time\".  A standard ntpd or openntpd server works, too.\nDo have your devices query the NTP servers at random times of the day.  For example every 43200 seconds since boot is good, at midnight every day is bad.\nDo re-query DNS for a new NTP server IP address if one of the current NTP servers stops responding, though not more often than once per hour.\nRead the\nnew SNTP RFC\nif you are implementing an SNTP client.\nWe can refer you to consultants with vast expertise in the NTP protocol and time-keeping applications who can help.  Just email Ask Bjørn Hansen at\nask@develooper.com\n.\nOpen source projects\nOpen Source projects are of course particularly welcome to use the pool in their default setup, but we ask that you\nget a vendor zone\nwhen using the pool as a default configuration.\nVendor FAQ\nMost questions should be answered elsewhere on the page.  Here are some that didn't fit in above.\nWhy use special hostnames for vendors?\nThe special hostnames allows us some control of the traffic so we\n\tcan optimize our load distribution and match clients to the best\n\tservers.  It also gives better options for continuing support in case\n\tof problems with segments of the client population.  (See the links in\n\tthe\nbasic guidelines\nsection).\nStatus\n|\nCommunity"

Users are *strongly* encouraged to upgrade to the network\ntime protocol (NTP), which is both more accurate and more robust.\n2. Users of the NIST \"DAYTIME\" protocol on tcp port 13 are also strongly encouraged to upgrade to the\nnetwork time protocol, which provides greater accuracy and requires less network bandwidth.\nThe NIST time client (nistime-32bit.exe) supports both protocols.\n3.

    "content": "NTP SERVERS — NTP серверы точного времени\n--\n:\n--\n:\n--\n(\nUTC\n)\nNTP\nNetwork Time Protocol — сетевой протокол для синхронизации внутренних часов компьютера с использованием сетей с переменной латентностью, основанных на коммутации пакетов.\nХотя традиционно NTP использует для своей работы протокол UDP, он также способен работать и поверх TCP. Система NTP чрезвычайно устойчива к изменениям латентности среды передачи.\nВремя, представляется в системе NTP 64-битным числом, состоящим из 32-битного счетчика секунд и 32-битного счетчика долей секунды, позволяя передавать время в диапазоне 2\n32\nсекунд, с теоретической точностью 2\n-32\nсекунды. Поскольку шкала времени в NTP повторяется каждые 2\n32\nсекунды (136 лет), получатель должен хотя бы примерно знать текущее время (с точностью 68 лет). Также следует учитывать, что время отсчитывается с полуночи 1 января 1900 года, а не с 1970, поэтому из времени NTP нужно вычитать почти 70 лет (с учетом високосных лет), чтобы корректно совместить время с Windows или Unix-системами.\nКак это работает\nNTP-серверы работают в иерархической сети, каждый уровень иерархии называется ярусом (stratum). Ярус 0 представлен эталонными часами. За эталон берется сигнал GPS (Global Positioning System) или службы ACTS (Automated Computer Time Service). На нулевом ярусе NTP-серверы не работают.\nNTP-серверы яруса 1 получают данные о времени от эталонных часов. NTP-серверы яруса 2 синхронизируются с серверами яруса 1. Всего может быть до 15 ярусов.\nNTP-серверы и NTP-клиенты получают данные о времени от серверов яруса 1, хотя на практике NTP-клиентам лучше не делать этого, поскольку тысячи индивидуальных клиентских запросов окажутся слишком большой нагрузкой для серверов яруса 1. Лучше настроить локальный NTP-сервер, который ваши клиенты будут использовать для получения информации о времени.\nИерархическая структура протокола NTP является отказоустойчивой и избыточной. Рассмотрим пример его работы. Два NTP-сервера яруса 2 синхронизируются с шестью различными серверами яруса 1, каждый — по независимому каналу. Внутренние узлы синхронизируются с внутренними NTP-серверами. Два NTP-сервера яруса 2 координируют время друг с другом. В случае отказа линии связи с сервером яруса 1 или с одним из серверов уровня 2 избыточный сервер уровня 2 берет на себя процесс синхронизации.\nАналогично узлы и устройства яруса 3 могут использовать любой из серверов яруса 2. Что еще более важно, так это то, что наличие избыточной сети серверов NTP гарантирует постоянную доступность серверов времени. Синхронизируясь с несколькими серверами точного времени, NTP использует данные всех источников, чтобы высчитать наиболее точное время.\nСтоит отметить, что протокол NTP не устанавливает время в чистом виде. Он корректирует локальные часы с использованием временного смещения, разницы между временем на NTP-сервере и локальных часах. Серверы и клиенты NTP настраивают свои часы, синхронизируясь с текущим временем постепенно либо единовременно.\nПолезные ссылки\nОфициальный сайт Network Time Protocol\nДомашняя страница проекта NTP\nСообщество поддержки документации NTP\nСайт проекта NTP-пулов\nСайт производителя NTP-решений Meinberg\nПорт ПО ntpd для Windows от Meinberg\nАвторский сайт Дэвида Тейлора о протоколе NTP\nГлавная\nNTP\nСерверы\nНастройка\nО проекте\nВремя с NTP-сервера (\nUTC\n)\n--\n:\n--\n:\n--\nВремя на компьютере (\nUTC\n)\n--\n:\n--\n:\n--\nСменить часовой пояс для показа времени с NTP-сервера можно на\nглавной странице\nсайта.\nСоглашение об использовании\nИнформеры\nКонтакты\n© 2007—2025 NTP SERVERS\nВсе права защищены."

Click on your continent to see which country-zones are available there.\nWhen using the by-country zones, be careful: some of them currently contain only one or two servers, so you are probably better off using either the zone of a nearby country, or using the continent or global zone (This is sometimes also valid if you live in a big country).

It is specified by the following documents:\nRFC 5905: Network Time Protocol Version 4: Protocol and Algorithms Specification\nRFC 5906: Network Time Protocol Version 4: Autokey Specification\nRFC 5907: Definitions of Managed Objects for Network Time Protocol Version 4 (NTPv4)\nRFC 5908: Network Time Protocol (NTP) Server Option for DHCPv6\nNTP version 3 was an internet draft standard, formalized in\nRFC 1305\n.\nWhy is NTP Important?\nIn a commercial environment, accurate time stamps are essential to everything from maintaining and troubleshooting equipment and forensic analysis of distributed attacks, to resolving disputes among parties contesting a commercially valuable time-sensitive transaction. In a programming environment, time stamps are usually used to determine what bits of code need to be rebuilt as part of a dependency checking process as they relate to other bits of code and the time stamps on them, and without good time stamps your entire development process can be brought to a complete standstill. Within law enforcement, they are essential for correlation of distributed communication events, forensic analysis, and potential evidentiary use in criminal proceedings. In essence, all debugging, security, audit, and authentication is founded on the basis of event correlation (knowing exactly what happened in what order, and on which side), and that depends on good time synchronization.\nAnother good explanation for this issue comes from\nThomas Akin\n, in chapter 10 of his book\nHardening Cisco Routers\n:\nTime is inherently important to the function of routers and networks. It provides the only frame of reference between all devices on the network. This makes synchronized time extremely important. Without synchronized time, accurately correlating information between devices becomes difficult, if not impossible. When it comes to security, if you cannot successfully compare logs between each of your routers and all your network servers, you will find it very hard to develop a reliable picture of an incident. Finally, even if you are able to put the pieces together, unsynchronized times, especially between log files, may give an attacker with a good attorney enough wiggle room to escape prosecution.\nAdditional information on this subject can be found at\nUC Berkeley\n, in\nRik Farrow's\nNetwork Defense\ncolumns for\nNetwork Magazine\n, and in the\nLinux System Administrators Guide\nat the Linux Documentation Project.\nLegal Requirements Around Time\nPlease note, we are not lawyers, and nothing we say here can be construed as being legal advice.\nThat said, we believe that we can identify potential issues that you may need to be concerned about, although you'll need to talk to your lawyers to get their official legal opinion on these subjects.\nThere are legal requirements for good time synchronization, both in the US and abroad. In the US, legal requirements from\nCALEA, the DOJ, the FBI, and the FCC\nare currently set for a minimum accuracy of 200ms (two hundred milliseconds), and in 2006 this was extended to cover communications that occur via IP-based protocols, especially including networks using VOIP or VOIP-like technology (where you would be considered to be the equivalent of a telco), and might also be construed to include chat, irc, or any other IP-based communications protocol. In Europe, there are proposals are on the table to tighten this requirement to ten milliseconds (see Agentschap Telecom, Format for date and time, ETSI/TC LI Rap#16, Groningen, 27-28 Jun 2007, Doc. ETSI/LI-rap16-td12), and in part this is being used as justification for the same level of standard in the US by the DOJ, FBI, and FCC in FCC Notice RM-11376.\nThen there the\nFederal Rules of Evidence\n, which govern the introduction of evidence in proceedings, both civil and criminal, in US Federal courts. While they do not apply to suits in state courts, the rules of many states have been closely modeled on these provisions. Of course, these rules may not be completely transferrable to other legal jurisdictions in other countries, but they should serve as a good initial guideline.\nExport Restrictions\nPlease note, we are not lawyers, and the following cannot be construed as legal advice. Before shipping any product that might be subject to US Export Restrictions, you and your lawyers should review all of the\nUS Bureau of Industry and Security documents on the Export Administration Regulations\nand make your own determination of what issues are applicable to you and which guidelines you need to adhere to.\nThat said, neither\nThe NTP Project\nnor\nNetwork Time Foundation\nhave applied for a\nCCATS (Commodity Classification Automated Tracking System)\nID or an\nExport Control Classification Number\nfor the NTP protocol, algorithms, or source code.\nThis is an\nopen source\nproject that is available to the entire world, and therefore we believe it is not subject to any export controls. In addition, we do not do any encryption internally to our code, although we do make use of libraries from the\nOpenSSL project\nto generate keys and to check keys, during the process of authenticating a server to one or more clients. Note that\nOpenSSL\nis also another open source project, and is developed entirely outside of the US specifically to avoid any entanglements with export restrictions. As such, it should be covered under standard re-export clauses, and as a\nTSU Exception\n, in accordance with\nEAR Section 740.13(e)\n.\nThe NTP Project\nThe NTP Project\nproduces a reference implementation of the NTP protocol and implementation documentation through a largely volunteer effort.\nBuilding NTP\nFor instructions on building NTP from a tarball, see the\nREADME\nand\nINSTALL\nfiles in the tarball.\nInformation about building NTP from a repository is available on the\nSoftwareDevelopment\npage.\nNTP Reference Clocks, Documentation, Time Sources, and Reference Library\nA list of reference clocks, ntp documentation, time and frequency standard stations, and time and frequency standard station transmission data is maintained at the\nNTP website\n. Background information about NTP, along with briefings and a bibliography, are available at the\nReference Library\n.\nThe NTP Project is part of\nNetwork Time Foundation\n, a 501(c)(3) Public Benefit Corporation.\nIETF NTP Working Group\nFrom 2004 thru 2008, we hosted the\nIETF NTP Working Group\npublic resources at this site. \nThe ostensible goal of this working group is to update the NTP protocol specification and advance the standardization status of NTP based on the extensive work from the NTP community.\nHow can I help?\nIf you'd like to help the NTP Project and/or the community it serves, there are several ways to do that. Here are a few:\nJoin the Network Time Foundation's Network Time Consortium\nEnhance the code or fix some bugs\nCheck out\nour \"Help Wanted\"\npage\nContacting Us\nTo contact the NTP web maintainer or any of the NTP developer team, please see the\ncontact page\n.

NTP users looking for information about installing, configuring, etc. NTP should visit the\nSupport\nWeb.\nPlease read the\nRules Of Engagement\nbefore using servers from these lists.\nThese lists are updated frequently and should not be cached or scraped.\nRead\nManagingYourListEntries\nand then\nAbout the Public NTP Time Server Lists\nFinding A Time Server\nBrowsing the Lists\nSearching for A Time Server\nAdding your Server to the Lists\nRemoving your Server from the Lists\nReporting Broken Time Servers\nAbout the Public NTP Time Server Lists\nThe lists are provided for information purposes only and represent the best information available at the current date. The operators of the servers listed do not commit to provide time service other than on a volunteer basis and with no guarantee of accuracy or availability. Further information of a technical nature can be obtained from\nhttps://www.ntp.org/\n.\nThe list of primary (\nstratum 1\n) and secondary (\nstratum 2\n) designates the NTP time servers available for public access under stated restrictions. Each entry gives the country code, state (US only), host name, Internet address, approximate location and geographic coordinates (if available), synchronization source (stratum, type of radio or satellite receiver and host type), suggested service area, access policy (as notified) and responsible person name and e-mail address. Most servers indicate the NTP version as well. It is always wise to consult the DNS to verify host addresses, which are changed from time to time. When more than one address is given, preference should given to each in order.\nPlease respect the access policy as stated by the responsible person. It is very important that potential clients avoid use of servers not listed as open access, unless approved first by the responsible person. This especially includes indiscriminate use of servers not listed in the list, since this can be disruptive. The responsible person should always be notified upon establishment of regular operations with servers listed as open access. Servers listed as closed access should NOT be used without prior permission, since this may disrupt ongoing activities in which these servers are involved.\nAll primary and secondary servers listed have no access restrictions, so that service is available for any client with a valid IP address. Where noted, some servers enforce a limit on the number of clients from any one network other than the server network itself. Where noted, some servers provide a cryptographic authentication service. Contact the site operators for further details.\nFinding A Time Server\nBrowsing the Lists\nThe\ncomplete\nlists are available from the following links. For detailed information about a server click the hostname in the list.\nPublic NTP Pool Time Servers\nPublic NTP Secondary (stratum 2) Time Servers\nPublic NTP Primary (stratum 1) Time Servers\nSearching for A Time Server\nUse\nWebSearch\nto search the Time Server Lists based on various criteria.\nYou may also search for your List entry by entering a portion of your host name (e.g. the domain) as\nlower case\ntext in the\nGo/Search\nbox at the top of any page and clicking the\nGo/Search\nbutton. If there is only one match you will see that Time Server List entry. If there are multiple matches you will see a page with clickable links to the matching entries.\nAdding your Server to the Lists\nTime Server operators may add, and maintain, their own List entries after they\nregister\nto edit this wiki.\nThis is the recommended means of managing your List entries.\nPlease read\nManagingYourListEntries\nfor more information.\nRead\nManagingYourListEntries\nand then\nRemoving your Server from the Lists\nTime Server operators who wish to remove their servers from the list may to so by editing their List entries and changing the\nServerStratum\nto\nInactive\n.\nTime Server operators must be\nregistered\nand must be on their List entry ACL to be able to edit their entries.\nTime Server operators may choose submit a removal request via e-mail to\nwebmaster\n. Removal requests submitted in this fashion will be processed by a volunteer when time permits.\nReporting Broken Time Servers\nAnyone discovering Time Servers that are broken (e.g. non-functional, incorrect stratum, etc.) for an extended period of time should contact\nwebmaster\nonly after attempting to contact the server operator.\nProblems with the\nNTP Pool\nmust be reported to the\nNTP Pool Manager\n.\nE\ndit\n|\nA\nttach\n|\nP\nrint version\n|\nH\nistory\n: r42\n<\nr41\n<\nr40\n<\nr39\n|\nB\nacklinks\n|\nV\niew wiki text\n|\nEdit\nw\niki text\n|\nM\nore topic actions\nTopic revision: r42 - 07 Aug 2024,\nDruLavigne\nServers\nLog In\nRegister\nTime Servers\nRules Of Engagement\nNTP Pool Servers\nSecondary Servers\nPrimary Servers\nToolbox\nCreate New Topic\nIndex\nSearch\nChanges\nNotifications\nRSS Feed\nStatistics\nPreferences\nWebs\nDev\nMain\nServers\nSupport\nSystem\nUsers\n© 2025\nNetwork Time Foundation"

In most cases the accuracy of the NTP secondary (stratum 2) servers is only slightly degraded relative to the primary servers and, as a group, the secondary servers may be just as reliable. As a general rule, a secondary server should use a primary server only under the following conditions:\nThe secondary server provides synchronization to a sizable population of other servers and clients on the order of 100 or more.\nThe server operates with at least two and preferably three other secondary servers in a common synchronization subnet designed to provide reliable service, even if some servers or the lines connecting them fail.\nThe administration(s) that operates these servers coordinates other servers within the region, in order to reduce the resources required outside that region. Note that at least some interregional resources are required in order to ensure reliable service.\nIn order to ensure reliability, clients should operate with several different servers and avoid common points of failure. As a general rule, between three and five servers are sufficient, but they should be selected from different networks. No more than two clients per network should use the same server on another network; however, in order to simplify management of host configuration tables, many hosts on the same network may use the same (redundant) servers on the same network.\nThere are many scenarios where the above rules may not apply, especially large campus or corporate networks, clients with intermittent connectivity and security considerations, which are beyond the scope of this page. Additional information can be found at the\nNTP web site\nand the NTP software documentation, project page and FAQ linked from there.\nUnix users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to the latest NTP Version 4 software in the compressed archive available from the NTP web site. Besides providing more accurate, reliable service, the latest version automatically increases the polling intervals for all peer associations, but without sacrificing performance. This can significantly reduce network loads, as well as the loads on the busy primary servers, some of which have over 700 clients.\nE\ndit\n|\nA\nttach\n|\nP\nrint version\n|\nH\nistory\n: r10\n<\nr9\n<\nr8\n<\nr7\n|\nB\nacklinks\n|\nV\niew wiki text\n|\nEdit\nw\niki text\n|\nM\nore topic actions\nTopic revision: r9 - 28 Sep 2020,\nKamranKabiri\nServers\nLog In\nRegister\nTime Servers\nRules Of Engagement\nNTP Pool Servers\nSecondary Servers\nPrimary Servers\nToolbox\nCreate New Topic\nIndex\nSearch\nChanges\nNotifications\nRSS Feed\nStatistics\nPreferences\nWebs\nDev\nMain\nServers\nSupport\nSystem\nUsers\n© 2025\nNetwork Time Foundation"

    "content": "NTPPoolServers < Servers < Network Time Foundation's NTP Support Wiki\nNTP Pool Time Servers\npool.ntp.org\nuses DNS round robin to make a random selection from a pool of time servers who have\nvolunteered\nto be in the pool. This is usually good enough for end-users. The minimal\nntpd\nconfiguration file (e.g.\n/etc/ntpd.conf\n) for using\npool.ntp.org\nis:\ndriftfile /var/lib/ntp/ntp.drift\nserver 0.pool.ntp.org\nserver 1.pool.ntp.org\nserver 2.pool.ntp.org\nserver 3.pool.ntp.org\nAny questions about the pool.ntp.org server pool should be directed to the\npool mailing list\n.\nTime server operators are encouraged to visit the\nNTP Pool\nweb-site to find out how they can join the NTP pool.\nThe NTP Pool DNS system automatically picks time servers which are geographically close for you, but if you want to choose explicitly, there are sub-zones of pool.ntp.org.  The \"continent\" ones are:\nArea:\nHostName:\nWorldwide\npool.ntp.org\nAsia\nasia.pool.ntp.org\nEurope\neurope.pool.ntp.org\nNorth America\nnorth-america.pool.ntp.org\nOceania\noceania.pool.ntp.org\nSouth America\nsouth-america.pool.ntp.org\nThere are also sub-zones for many countries.  Click on your continent to see which country-zones are available there.\nWhen using the by-country zones, be careful: some of them currently contain only one or two servers, so you are probably better off using either the zone of a nearby country, or using the continent or global zone (This is sometimes also valid if you live in a big country).   In general though, just use the \"global\" zone as in the suggested configuration near the top of the page and let the system sort it out for you.\nRelated topics:\nRulesOfEngagement\n,\nStratumTwoTimeServers\n,\nManagingYourListEntries\n,\nhttps://www.pool.ntp.org\nThis topic: Servers\n>\nNTPPoolServers\nTopic revision:\n15 Feb 2024,\nDruLavigne\n© 2025\nNetwork Time Foundation"

This is a convenient service, so you do not have to come back and check all the time if something has changed. To subscribe, please add a bullet with your\nWikiName\nin alphabetical order to this list:\nDOkuLuxembourg\n:\nPublicTimeServer001880\nDavidStewart\n:\nPublicTimeServer001590\nDruLavigne\n: *\nEugeniiaNemirova\n:\nPublicTimeServer001862\nFrancisSpencer\n:\nPublicTimeServer001331\nGyonghyonKim\n:\nNTPPoolServers\nPublicTimeServer001793\nJapanStandardTimeGroup\n:\nPublicTimeServer001611\nServiceArea\nLeonaMyers\n:\nNTPPoolServers\nMichaelSHaodom\n:\nPublicTimeServer001845\nMohammadBakeer\n:\nWebHome\nRSPinternetGroup\n:\nServerForm\nPublicTimeServer001870\nPublicTimeServer001872\nShaneHay\n:\nPublicTimeServer001768\nSunDevil\n:\nPublicTimeServer000785\nPublicTimeServer000786\nPublicTimeServer000010\nPublicTimeServer001432\nPublicTimeServer000314\nPublicTimeServer000604\nPublicTimeServer000609\nTakagiKenji\n:\nPublicTimeServer000458\n► Notification help\n▼ Notification help\nAbout the Web changes notification service\nEach Foswiki web has an automatic e-mail notification service that sends you an e-mail with links to all of the topics modified since the last alert.\nUsers subscribe to email notifications using their\nWikiName\nor an alternative email address, and can specify the webs/topics they wish to track. Whole groups of users can also be subscribed for notification.\nThe general format of a subscription is:\nthree spaces\n*\nsubscriber\n[\n:\ntopics\n]\nWhere\nsubscriber\ncan be a\nWikiName\n, an email address, or a group name. If\nsubscriber\ncontains any characters that are not legal in an email address, then it must be enclosed in 'single' or \"double\" quotes.\nNote:\nThe guest user\nWikiGuest\ndoes not have an email address mapped to it, and will never receive email regardless of the configuration of that user.\ntopics\nis an optional space-separated list of topics:\n...\nwithout\na\nWeb.\nprefix\n...that exist in this web.\nUsers may further customize the specific content they will receive using the following controls:\nUsing wild-card character in topic names\n- You can use\n*\nin a topic name, where it is treated as a\nwildcard character\n. A\n*\nwill match zero or more other characters - so, for example,\nFred*\nwill match all topic names starting with\nFred\n,\n*Fred\nwill match all topic names\nending\nwith\nFred\n, and\n*\nwill match\nall\ntopic names.\nUnsubscribing to specific topics\n- Each topic may optionally be preceded by a '+' or '-' sign. The '+' sign means \"subscribe to this topic\". The '-' sign means \"unsubscribe\" or \"don't send notifications regarding this particular topic\". This allows users to elect to filter out certain topics. Topic filters ('-') take precedence over topic includes ('+') i.e. if you unsubscribe from a topic it will cancel out any subscriptions to that topic.\nIncluding child-topics in subscription\n- Each topic may optionally be followed by an integer in parentheses, indicating the depth of the tree of children below that topic. Changes in all these children will be detected and reported along with changes to the topic itself.\nNote\nThis uses the Foswiki \"Topic parent\" feature.\nSubscribing to entire topic (\"news mode\")\n- Each topic may optionally be immediately followed by an exclamation mark ! and/or a question mark ? with no intervening spaces, indicating that the topic (and children if there is a tree depth specifier as well) should be mailed out as\ncomplete topics\ninstead of change summaries. ! causes the full topic to be mailed every time\neven if there have been no changes\n, and ? will mail the full topic only if there have been changes. One can limit the content of the subscribed topic to send out by inserting\n%STARTPUBLISH%\nand\n%STOPPUBLISH%\nmarkers within the topic.\nExamples:\nSubscribe Daisy to all changes to topics in this web.\n* daisy.cutter@flowers.com\nSubscribe Daisy to all changes to topics that start with\nWeb\n.\n* daisy.cutter@flowers.com : Web*\nSubscribe Daisy to changes to topics starting with\nPetal\n, and their immediate children,\nWeedKillers\nand children to a depth of 3, and all topics that match start with\nPretty\nand end with\nFlowers\ne.g.\nPrettyPinkFlowers\n.\n* DaisyCutter: Petal* (1) WeedKillers (3) Pretty*Flowers\nSubscribe StarTrekFan to changes to all topics that start with\nStar\nexcept\nthose that end in\nWars\n,\nsInTheirEyes\nor\nshipTroopers\n.\n* StarTrekFan: Star* - *Wars - *sInTheirEyes - *shipTroopers\nSubscribe Daisy to the full content of\nNewsLetter\nwhenever it has changed.\n* daisy@flowers.com: NewsLetter?\nSubscribe buttercup to\nNewsLetter\nand its immediate children, even if it hasn't changed.\n* buttercup@flowers.com: NewsLetter! (1)\nSubscribe GardenGroup (which includes Petunia) to all changed topics under\nAllNewsLetters\nto a depth of 3. Then unsubscribe Petunia from the\nManureNewsLetter\n, which she would normally get as a member of GardenGroup:\n* GardenGroup: AllNewsLetters? (3)\n   * petunia@flowers.com: - ManureNewsLetter\nSubscribe\nIT:admins\n(a non-Foswiki group defined by an alternate user mapping) to all changes to Web* topics.\n* 'IT:admins' : Web*\nA user may be listed many times in the WebNotify topic. Where a user has several lines in WebNotify that all match the same topic, they will only be notified about\nchanges\nin that topic\nonce\n(though they will still receive individual mails for news topics).\nIf a\ngroup\nis listed for notification, the group will be recursively expanded to the email addresses of all members.\nWarning:\nBecause an email address is not linked to a user name, there is no way for Foswiki to check access controls for subscribers identified by email addresses. A subscriber identified by an email address alone will only be sent change notifications if the topic they are subscribed to is readable by guest users. You can limit which email addresses can be used in WebNotify, or even block use of emails altogther, using the\n{MailerContrib}{EmailFilterIn}\nsetting in\nconfigure\n.\nTip:\nList names in alphabetical order to make it easier to find the names.\nNote for System Administrators:\nNotification is supported by an add-on to the Foswiki kernel called the MailerContrib. See the\nMailerContrib\ntopic for details of how to set up this service.\nNote:\nIf you prefer a news feed, point your reader to\nWebRss\n(for RSS 1.0 feeds) or\nWebAtom\n(for ATOM 1.0 feeds). Learn more at\nWebRssBase\nand\nWebAtomBase\n, respectively.\nRelated topics:\nUsers.WikiUsers\n,\nUserRegistration\nE\ndit\n|\nA\nttach\n|\nP\nrint version\n|\nH\nistory\n: r40\n<\nr39\n<\nr38\n<\nr37\n|\nB\nacklinks\n|\nV\niew wiki text\n|\nEdit\nw\niki text\n|\nM\nore topic actions\nTopic revision: r40 - 29 Jan 2025,\nDOkuLuxembourg\nServers\nLog In\nRegister\nTime Servers\nRules Of Engagement\nNTP Pool Servers\nSecondary Servers\nPrimary Servers\nToolbox\nCreate New Topic\nIndex\nSearch\nChanges\nNotifications\nRSS Feed\nStatistics\nPreferences\nWebs\nDev\nMain\nServers\nSupport\nSystem\nUsers\n© 2025\nNetwork Time Foundation"

It is specified by the following documents:\nRFC 5905: Network Time Protocol Version 4: Protocol and Algorithms Specification\nRFC 5906: Network Time Protocol Version 4: Autokey Specification\nRFC 5907: Definitions of Managed Objects for Network Time Protocol Version 4 (NTPv4)\nRFC 5908: Network Time Protocol (NTP) Server Option for DHCPv6\nNTP version 3 was an internet draft standard, formalized in\nRFC 1305\n.\nWhy is NTP Important?\nIn a commercial environment, accurate time stamps are essential to everything from maintaining and troubleshooting equipment and forensic analysis of distributed attacks, to resolving disputes among parties contesting a commercially valuable time-sensitive transaction. In a programming environment, time stamps are usually used to determine what bits of code need to be rebuilt as part of a dependency checking process as they relate to other bits of code and the time stamps on them, and without good time stamps your entire development process can be brought to a complete standstill. Within law enforcement, they are essential for correlation of distributed communication events, forensic analysis, and potential evidentiary use in criminal proceedings. In essence, all debugging, security, audit, and authentication is founded on the basis of event correlation (knowing exactly what happened in what order, and on which side), and that depends on good time synchronization.\nAnother good explanation for this issue comes from\nThomas Akin\n, in chapter 10 of his book\nHardening Cisco Routers\n:\nTime is inherently important to the function of routers and networks. It provides the only frame of reference between all devices on the network. This makes synchronized time extremely important. Without synchronized time, accurately correlating information between devices becomes difficult, if not impossible. When it comes to security, if you cannot successfully compare logs between each of your routers and all your network servers, you will find it very hard to develop a reliable picture of an incident. Finally, even if you are able to put the pieces together, unsynchronized times, especially between log files, may give an attacker with a good attorney enough wiggle room to escape prosecution.\nAdditional information on this subject can be found at\nUC Berkeley\n, in\nRik Farrow's\nNetwork Defense\ncolumns for\nNetwork Magazine\n, and in the\nLinux System Administrators Guide\nat the Linux Documentation Project.\nLegal Requirements Around Time\nPlease note, we are not lawyers, and nothing we say here can be construed as being legal advice.\nThat said, we believe that we can identify potential issues that you may need to be concerned about, although you'll need to talk to your lawyers to get their official legal opinion on these subjects.\nThere are legal requirements for good time synchronization, both in the US and abroad. In the US, legal requirements from\nCALEA, the DOJ, the FBI, and the FCC\nare currently set for a minimum accuracy of 200ms (two hundred milliseconds), and in 2006 this was extended to cover communications that occur via IP-based protocols, especially including networks using VOIP or VOIP-like technology (where you would be considered to be the equivalent of a telco), and might also be construed to include chat, irc, or any other IP-based communications protocol. In Europe, there are proposals are on the table to tighten this requirement to ten milliseconds (see Agentschap Telecom, Format for date and time, ETSI/TC LI Rap#16, Groningen, 27-28 Jun 2007, Doc. ETSI/LI-rap16-td12), and in part this is being used as justification for the same level of standard in the US by the DOJ, FBI, and FCC in FCC Notice RM-11376.\nThen there the\nFederal Rules of Evidence\n, which govern the introduction of evidence in proceedings, both civil and criminal, in US Federal courts. While they do not apply to suits in state courts, the rules of many states have been closely modeled on these provisions. Of course, these rules may not be completely transferrable to other legal jurisdictions in other countries, but they should serve as a good initial guideline.\nExport Restrictions\nPlease note, we are not lawyers, and the following cannot be construed as legal advice. Before shipping any product that might be subject to US Export Restrictions, you and your lawyers should review all of the\nUS Bureau of Industry and Security documents on the Export Administration Regulations\nand make your own determination of what issues are applicable to you and which guidelines you need to adhere to.\nThat said, neither\nThe NTP Project\nnor\nNetwork Time Foundation\nhave applied for a\nCCATS (Commodity Classification Automated Tracking System)\nID or an\nExport Control Classification Number\nfor the NTP protocol, algorithms, or source code.\nThis is an\nopen source\nproject that is available to the entire world, and therefore we believe it is not subject to any export controls. In addition, we do not do any encryption internally to our code, although we do make use of libraries from the\nOpenSSL project\nto generate keys and to check keys, during the process of authenticating a server to one or more clients. Note that\nOpenSSL\nis also another open source project, and is developed entirely outside of the US specifically to avoid any entanglements with export restrictions. As such, it should be covered under standard re-export clauses, and as a\nTSU Exception\n, in accordance with\nEAR Section 740.13(e)\n.\nThe NTP Project\nThe NTP Project\nproduces a reference implementation of the NTP protocol and implementation documentation through a largely volunteer effort.\nBuilding NTP\nFor instructions on building NTP from a tarball, see the\nREADME\nand\nINSTALL\nfiles in the tarball.\nInformation about building NTP from a repository is available on the\nSoftwareDevelopment\npage.\nNTP Reference Clocks, Documentation, Time Sources, and Reference Library\nA list of reference clocks, ntp documentation, time and frequency standard stations, and time and frequency standard station transmission data is maintained at the\nNTP website\n. Background information about NTP, along with briefings and a bibliography, are available at the\nReference Library\n.\nThe NTP Project is part of\nNetwork Time Foundation\n, a 501(c)(3) Public Benefit Corporation.\nIETF NTP Working Group\nFrom 2004 thru 2008, we hosted the\nIETF NTP Working Group\npublic resources at this site. \nThe ostensible goal of this working group is to update the NTP protocol specification and advance the standardization status of NTP based on the extensive work from the NTP community.\nHow can I help?\nIf you'd like to help the NTP Project and/or the community it serves, there are several ways to do that. Here are a few:\nJoin the Network Time Foundation's Network Time Consortium\nEnhance the code or fix some bugs\nCheck out\nour \"Help Wanted\"\npage\nContacting Us\nTo contact the NTP web maintainer or any of the NTP developer team, please see the\ncontact page\n.
